what form of exercise takes belly fat off and abdominal fat off the fastest like what is going to be the
biggest lever that you can pull resistance training great for building muscle which helps you out with fat
loss cardio definitely is incinerating some calories but longer term like what is going to happen what's
the tiebreaker when they actually go head-to-head so break it all down you'll have a solid solution and a
longer term Playbook looking at a lot of literature so that this is completely un biased and real after
today's video I put a link down below for 10% off of your lithan a from timeline nutrition your lithan a is
what is called a postbiotic it's something that is extracted typically in this case from pomegranates and
it's a compound that induces what is called mitophagy so it encourages the mitochondria to essentially
go through a recycling now mitop pure which is the patented version of urethan a has a lot of clinical
studies published on it very legit stuff I've talked about it with Dr Gabrielle lion if you're looking at trying
to get sort of the I guess you could call it the autophagy of the mitochondria mitophagy and improve
mitochondrial Health potentially better aging all these things EUR aithan a is probably on the Forefront
when it comes down to the emerging promising compounds really interesting stuff not to mention there
is evidence to support that it can help protect against a visceral fat accumulation as well well which is
hugely important so that link down below gets you 10% off of timelines euroi and a at the very least at
least check out the link and read a little bit more about it because it's not just Thomas Delow talking this
is very real stuff so link is below this video in the top line of the description before we can put them
head-to-head we need to understand resistance training and cardio in isolation and the impact they
have on Fat Loss first of all there was a study published in sports medicine in 2022 took a look at 54
studies system static review and meta analysis lots and lots and lots of data comparing resistance
training to no exercise okay you're probably not surprised here but after four weeks resistance training
only 2.7 times per week so under three times per week technically for 45 minutes led to a 1.46%
decrease in their body fat percentage okay so you're looking at a good amount of body fat loss just by
adding resistance training in 2.7 not even three times per week technically so like two days one week 3
days another week for a month okay resistance training definitely burns fat but is it because you're
taking people that haven't exercised before and you're having them actually move and maybe that's an
hour that they're just away from the pantry that could be reality that's the sad thing so is it actually
burning much fat because you don't burn hardly any calories with recreational resistance training you
start burning more calories when you know what you're doing but you're just not burning that much it's
more about the metabolic stimulus well there's also a study that took a look at similar stuff in this case it
was a 12,000 person study over the course of 6 years and again they looked at resistance training
independent of cardio and other exercise they found that 60 to 120 minutes per week on average
ended up leading to an average of a 30% decrease in overall body fat Mass not a decrease in body fat
percentage but a decrease in body fat Mass over a six-year period now the hard part with large studies
like this 12,000 people over six years a lot of other things change so they know that people started
resistance training but maybe because they started getting biceps they started going to the beaches on
Sundays and flexing trying to pick up chicks that burns calories maybe they also sorted walking around
with their shirt off more because they wanted to show their bod that burns calories maybe they had
more sex that burns calories the point is is that you get what I'm saying it's like they didn't just add
resistance training in and then voila 6 years later they have a 30% drop in their overall fat Mass the
point is when you look at it statistically yes the resistance training alone burns fat we can't deny that but
here's some kind of cool news there is an interesting study this was a 12-week study had subjects do
either zero weight training two times per week weight training or three times per week weight training
and they found ultimately that the total fat mass that was lost between two times per week and three
times per week although decently significant was not very different between the two so two times per
week is all you really need the hard part that I have with using resistance training as your tool to lose fat
and only tool to lose fat is if you're only resistance training two days per week that leaves you five days

out of the week that you can still be going through the eloo Loco drive-thru right so you're I don't know
you're like okay today's my workout day I won't go to fast food today but tomorrow I will is it's not
enough to really Implement a huge lifestyle change for you so basically all you really need is 2 days per
week you don't need to do anything crazy but we still need to add some other stuff into the mix here so
now let's look at cardio and isolation because this is quite interesting this study was published in the
Journal of sports medicine and physical fitness and it was a one-year long study and they again were
looking at people that were running in this case they found that if people were to run about 5 km per
week with a diet change they would have a reduction of about 5.5 kilogram of fat Mass we're talking like
you know 15ish pounds we're talking a good amount of fat loss but that's with a diet change here's
what's cool if they were to run 5 kilometers per week without a diet change it was about 3.9 kilg of fat
Mass lost I don't know about you this is going to be real here if you could tell me that I would run 5
kilometers had to change my diet and I would lose five or six kilograms or I could continue to eat crap
not that I eat crap but if I could continue to eat whatever I want and do what I'm doing and just run 5
kilometers a week and lose almost 4 kilograms I think I'm going to keep my diet the same and I'm just
going to run the point in me saying this is that cardio is a big fat burner the problem with cardio which
we'll talk about in a little bit is it increases your appetite so you have to have control so this is a very real
thing there's no denying realistically that cardio burns more fat but it comes with its own flaws let's look
at another study though this study was published in the European Journal of preventive Cardiology and
this one is eye openening because this one had people three days per week do interval training at 90%
of their max heart rate so they had them work pretty darn hard three days per week and then another
group they restricted to 1,000 calories per day with no exercise so they they just had to diet
aggressively the weight loss in the diet only group 10.6% of their total weight loss 26.6% total fat Mass
lost that's a lot of fat that was dropped now what about the cardio group The cardio group lost 1.6% of
their weight and 5.5% of their fat Mass okay this is the unpopular opinion but the cold hard truth that
you need to hear if you want to drop fat the diet is the way to do it the cardio is not the best way to lose
fat the best way to lose your belly fat and lose abdominal fat is the diet okay so before you go and
Sprint off to do cardio ask yourself okay have I done enough cardio this week have I done two or three
sessions is more cardio going to help me or would I be better off to just restricting my calories chances
are you'd be better off just restricting your calories that day that comes with its own set of problems in
an Ideal World I would rather you be such a metabolic furnace that you can eat more and move more
and everything is copacetic and you're good but if you're trying to get your life on track I don't think
blasting yourself with cardio every day is the answer but make no mistake that blasting yourself with
cardio is going to burn more fat than blasting yourself with resistance training but now we need to look
at the studies that combine both resistance training and cardio and compare them directly with this we
look at a study from 2012 publish in the Journal of Applied physiology it was one of the landmark
papers when it comes down to this entire topic takes a look at resistance training versus aerobic versus
a combination aerobic training and aerobic plus resistance training led to the most significant fat loss
however there was not much change in fat loss at all from aerobic to aerobic plus resistance training no
additional fat was lost when resistance training was added into the mix however lean body mass was
better preserved now that clearly counts for something right now it sounds like I'm just a very Pro cardio
almost anti-resistance training guy I encourage you to take a quick look at me and hopefully you know
that I like resistance training I just feel like resistance training doesn't burn a lot of calories and if people
want the shortest path to losing fat we need to do cardio and we need to restrict some calories plain
and simple but the piece that we have to look at that probably is one of the most important that I
promised you I'd talk about is the influence of exercise on the appetite and this is where we can start to
programma tize this whole thing or programiz however you want to say it so with this we look at a study
that was published in the journal obesity had subjects run walk or do diddly squat now they found that
when they would run all the hunger hormones would increase we had an increase in Gin but there was
also increases in py and gp1 which can be appetite suppressing but these tend to elevate in unison like
when we do exercise bottom line is if gin's increasing you're probably eating you're just going to be
eating the walking group didn't have raises in any of these so the intensity starts to matter here so when
you go out and you run and you burn more calories overall you start to burn less of a percentage of it
from fat you just burn calories which means you possibly burn muscle too and then that sends a signal

to your body to eat afterwards the best way you can do your cardio is dose your high-intensity cardio to
the point where it's just quick spurts but the volume of your cardio things like walking or rucking slow J
doging but really low intensity stuff but then there was a study that took a look at resistance training in
full body upper body and lower body so basically in a full body or a split what they found is that full body
resistance training dramatically decreased the appetite much more than upper body or lower body
individually so full body resistance training seems to be the best for blunting the appetite so what do we
take away from this we take away the fact that it just fat loss is your goal restricting your calories
aggressively and doing two to three times per week of resistance training is probably going to be the
fastest way to blunt your appetite and also preserve muscle mass and also just get what you're after
right you're going to lose more fat when you reduce calories but when you reduce calories it sucks so
resistance training can blunt the appetite and resistance training can put on some muscle and also help
you burn a little bit of fat so that's the slow and steady effective actually it's pretty fast if you restrict
calories fast enough and hard enough if you're trying to do this a little bit more Fitness approach you
probably want a resistance train and do your cardio and you want to treat your cardio as interval
training whenever you can and then elevate your Baseline by walking more because at the end of the
day cardio is going to burn more fat than resistance training and the more fat that you want to burn I
hate to break it to you the more cardio you should probably do but the more cardio that you do the more
resistance training you should probably do to offset and preserve lean body mass so more cardio a tad
more resistance training if you don't want to diet as hard I'll see you tomorrow
