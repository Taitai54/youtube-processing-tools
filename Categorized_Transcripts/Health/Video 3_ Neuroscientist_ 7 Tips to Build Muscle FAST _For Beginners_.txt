if your goal is to build larger muscles there's a way to use your nervous system to increase the size of
those muscles heavy weights can help build muscle but they are not required for individuals that are
untrained moving weights in the 30 to 80% of that is going to be the most beneficial range in terms of
muscle hypertrophy and strength when we think about muscle we don't just want to think about muscle
the meat that is muscle but what controls that muscle and no surprise what controls muscle is the
nervous system if your goal is to build larger muscles there's a way to use your nervous system to
trigger hypertrophy to increase the size of those muscles and it is indeed controlled by the nervous
system so you can forget the idea that the muscles have memory or that muscles grow in response to
something that's just happening within the muscle it's the nerve to muscle connection that actually
creates hypertrophy weights in a very large range of sort of percentage of your maximum anywhere
from 30 to 80% so weights that are not very light but are moderately light too heavy can cause changes
in the connections between nerve and muscle that lead to muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy put
differently heavy weights can help build muscle and strength but they are not required what one has to
do is adhere to a certain number of parameters just a couple of key variables that I'll spell out for you
and if you do that you can greatly increase muscle hypertrophy muscle size and or muscle strength if
that's what you want to do and you don't necessarily have to use heavy weights in order to do that if
you want to get stronger it's really about moving progressively greater loads or increasing the amount of
weight that you move whereas if you're specifically interested in generating hypertrophy it's all about
trying to generate those really hard almost painful localized contractions of muscle now of course how
much weight you use in order to generate those contractions will also impact hypertrophy there's a lot
of information saying that you need to move weights that are you know 80 to 90% of your one rep
maximum or 70% or cycle that for 3 weeks on and then go to more moderate weights there there are a
lot of paths as as some people say there are a lot of ways to add up numbers to get 100 you know
there's a near infinite number of ways to add up different numbers to get to 100 and what's very clear
now from all the literature that's transpired and especially from the literature in this last 3 years is that
once you know roughly your one repetition maximum the maximum amount of weight that you can
perform an exercise with for one repetition in good form full full range of motion that it's very clear that
moving weights or using bands or using body weight for instance in the 30 to 80% of one rep maximum
that is going to be the most beneficial range in terms of muscle hypertrophy and strength so muscle
growth and strength so 30 to 80% of one repetition maximums it doesn't really seem to matter for sake
of hypertrophy except at the far ends when you're really trying to bias for strength now it is clear
however that one needs to perform those sets to failure where you can't perform another repetition in
good form again or near to failure for individuals that are untrained meaning they have been doing
resistance exercise for anywhere from Zer probably out to about 2 years although for some people it
might be 0 to one year but that those are the so-called beginners they're sort of untrained for those
people the key parameter seems to be to perform enough sets of a given exercise per muscle per week
okay the same is also true for people that have been training for one or two years or more what differs
is how many sets to perform depending on whether or not you're trained or untrain so let's say you're
somebody who's been doing some resistance exercise kind of on and off over the years and you decide
you want get serious about that for sake of sport or offsetting age related declines in strength the range
of sets to do in order to improve strength to activate these Cascades in the muscle ranges anywhere
from two believe it or not to 20 per week again these are sets per week and they don't necessarily all
have to be performed in the same weight training session I will talk about numbers of sessions so it
appears that five sets per week in this 30% to 80% of the one repetition maximum range getting close
to failure or or occasionally actually going to full muscular failure which isn't really full muscular failure
but the inability to generate a contraction of the muscle move the weight in good form about five sets
per week is what's required just to maintain your muscle so think about that if you're somebody who's
kind of averse to resistance training you are going to lose muscle size and strength your metabolism

will drop your posture will get worse everything in the in the context of nerve to muscle connectivity will
get worse over time unless you are generating five sets or more of this 30% to 80% of your one
repetition maximum per week so what this means is for the typical person who hasn't done a lot of
weight training you need to do at least five sets per muscle group now that's just to maintain and then
there's this huge range that goes all the way up to 15 and in some case 20 sets per week now how
many sets you perform is going to depend on the intensity of the work that you perform this is where it
gets a little bit controversial but I think nowadays most people agree and Galpin confirmed that 10% not
to be confused with the 10% uh we discussed earlier but 10% of the sets of a given uh workout or 10%
of workouts overall should be of the high intensity sort where one is actually working to muscular failure
but the point being that most of your training most of your sets should be not to failure and the reason
for that is it allows you to do more volume of work without fatiguing the nervous system and depleting
the nerve to MUSC musle Connection in ways that are detrimental so we can make this simple perform
anywhere from 5 to 15 sets of resistance exercise per week and that's per muscle and that's in this 30
to 80% of what your one repetition maximum that seems to be the the most scientifically supported way
of offsetting any decline in muscle strength if you're working in the kind of five set range and in
increasing muscle strength when you start to get up into the 10 and 15 set range now the caveat to that
is everyone varies and muscles vary in terms of their recoverability depending on how well you can
control the contraction of muscles deliberately and you can actually figure that out by sort of marching
you might take five minutes and just kind of march across your body and mentally try and control the
contractions of muscles in a very deliberate way to the point where you can generate a hard contraction
and you may have to move a limb in order to do this by the way I'm not talking about just mentally con
you know Contracting your bicep without moving your wrist I'm talking about doing that without any
weight in hand or any band or any resistance if you can gener a high-intensity contraction using these
upper motor neuron to motor lower motor neuron Pathways to muscle you might think well I should
perform many more sets right but actually the opposite is true if you can generate high-intensity
muscular contractions using your brain using your neurons it will take fewer sets in order to stimulate
the muscle to maintain itself and to stimulate the muscle in order to grow or get stronger there are some
other things that can enhance the whole process of building nerve to muscle connections making them
more efficient and generating if you like more strength and hypertrophy one of them I lo to say uh I was
told is in between set contractions uh the other name for this is the people in the gym does typically
seem to be guys in the gym flexing their muscles in between sets and indeed the research supports the
fact that contractions of about 30 seconds in between the actual work sets they're not going to favor
better performance on the work sets if anything they're going to compromise them but those hard
contractions in between sets for a variety of reasons related to local muscle metabolism as well as what
we talked about before which are stress tension and damage they seem to improve stress tension and
damage and the nerve to muscle contraction in ways that facilitate hypertrophy if you're wondering how
quickly to perform repetitions for sake of hypertrophy or strength gains anywhere from a half a second
per repetition all the way up to 8 seconds per repetition it doesn't seem to matter now how long to
recover between sets for hypertrophy and for strength gains it does seem that resting anywhere from 2
minutes or even three or four or even five or six minutes can be beneficial and of course we'd be remiss
if we didn't talk about time of day for training turns out that whether or not you do whether or not you
train in the morning or in the afternoon doesn't really seem to matter for sake of things like hypertrophy
and strength Etc everyone seems to have a time of day that they prefer to train I've said before for and
their reasons based on body temperature rhythms and cortisol release that training 30 minutes 3 hours
or 11 hours after your normal waking time can be very beneficial and can provide a sort of predictability
or regularity to when your body will be ready to train and best apt to train well there is some evidence
that training in the afternoon is better for performance whereas training for body composition changes
and strength changes Etc doesn't really matter when you train so you also want to make it compatible
with sleep compatible with work that really gets down into the weeds of optimization but I think it's
interesting to note that if you're going to train at a regular time you can take the days when you don't
train and use that to enhance your cognitive Focus for things that have nothing to do with exercise so
this might be writing or reading or music or math Etc
