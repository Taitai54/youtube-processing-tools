get started now with drafting up an email we can have it pretty simply write up an email to chase up an
invoice to do that here I can go down to ask me anything and I can add in a prompt to write me an email
adding specific details including the tone and length of email we our prompt added into co-pilot you can
simply click on the send button and you'll see in real time that co-pilot now generates us with a reply
yes we can see it adds up the subject it adds also the invoice number I provided and even mentions it
was due last Monday as I told co-pilot now you'll see because this is the free version of co-pilot it
doesn't know who you are but that doesn't matter too much because you can take a copy of this email
put it into Outlook or any other mail app and make the necessary changes to get it personalized to you
but a simple prompt has been transformed into a professional email but how about we up the game I
need to have a report generated for later on today outlines the challenges of project Green Space in
London with some changes in legislation can this co-pilot help me out but I believe it certainly can now
what I'm going to do is change the conversation by clicking the new topic button on the left of your
sidebar that cleans the slate and ensures the past email doesn't get added into any of the new answers
and co-pilot and this time we're going to give it a new prompt to draft me a a report and giving it an
outline of what I need and again the length and tone inside of our prompt with our prompt added into
this dialogue where I'm asking co-pilot to go ahead and write this report for us we can see that co-pilot
can take information from the web and begin to build out this report report yes we can see straightway
executive summary introduction as it builds it out we can see it live on the screen and we can now see
in the sidebar that we've got a report and once again we'll expand the window so we can see more of
what's been created you can see conclusion challenges impacts on green projects and all the changes
in government policies and it's also referenced the relevant information from different sources for
example here this has been taken from a UK government post around changes in the Regeneration of
land so very professional reports written in just a few minutes we can also take this into word we'll go to
the bottom and select copy open Word and simply paste in the contents here you now see we've got
our Rapport added into Microsoft Word yes you'll need to tailor some of those formats and remove
those references if needed but of course what we now have is a report that we can now share
potentially of other stakeholders generated in minutes or you can further refine to make it even better

help us with some high level data analysis let's go ahead and ask co-pilot exactly that we can see that
Co pilot has now replied it did actually mention that it encounters some issues with file formats but not
to worry it still analyzed all of our Bild data 32 bills the total amount the number of bills that have been
unpaid and also the amounts unpaid and paid a simple question took less than a minute to generate
high level data analysis from a spreadsheet of data and we can even ask further questions of co-pilot to
further analyze our data you can now see we've asked co-pilot to provide a breakdown of bills by by
customer it's taken each of those customers from our spreadsheet and it's now looked at the bills for
each the amount the average and so forth and it's generated that again in less than a minute powerful
capability from co-pilot but co-pilot capabilities don't end there because we can have it generate images
for us yes using Microsoft designer which is integrated in co-pilot we can ask for it to create an image

more professional and you won't find anywhere else so designer and co-pilot can even improve your
presentations but how about social media posts because in Project greenspace we've got a community
