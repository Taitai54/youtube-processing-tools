If I Wanted to Go From $0 to $1M in 12 Months, Here’s What I’d Do
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW8mACQOfGo
I became a cash millionaire at 27 years old but if I had to do it again and go from broke to millionaire
business owner in the next 12 months this is exactly what I do if at any point dur in this video you think I
can't do this you might not be cut out to become a millionaire and that's okay but if you're part of the
select few who are willing to do the work then this video is for you so your first month of your millionaire
journey is going to be all about learning a high income skill so these are the five most in- demand High
income skills today first one is coding software you're hearing it all the time SAS you know SAS preneur
the second one is content creation you know everything around video editing graphic design essentially
helping people get their stories their message out to the world the third is copywriting learning how to
craft words in a structure that gets somebody to take action is a very high paying skill the fourth is
project management understanding how to take an idea all the way across to execution and
implementation is very valuable the fifth is sales even chat sales most people don't realize that nothing
happens until somebody sells something to another person and there are companies with products and
inventory that they would pay top dollar to have somebody else help sell and communicate to the
market and it can pay handsomely so I learned my first High income skill of all places in rehab I got
lucky honestly I ended up getting in trouble with the law as a teenager got released into a rehab center
that literally saved my life and I spent 11 months not only getting sober but trying to build the trust that I
lost with my parents and really just build build myself back up to being a normal person at the end of
that program I was helping the maintenance guy clean out one of these cabins and in one of the rooms
was this old computer and a book on Java programming sitting next to it I became obsessed with
writing code through that process I learned that that is actually a very high-paying highly valuable skill
and it was the first of several that allowed me to build the career in the entrepreneur Journey that I've
been on when you start you have to spend all your time learning the new skills the high income skill
even if you have a job you might be working 9 to 5 start learning between 5 to 9 the whole point is to
increase the value you bring to the marketplace it doesn't matter how much you think people should
pay you it's the kind of value that you bring so if you're doing something that is low paying like
restocking shelves like don't be upset if you're not making the big bucks the whole point is to figure out
how can you increase the value you provide to the market if you figure out what the market Wants What
It finds valuable and you learn that skill you will be rewarded accordingly which brings us to month two
which is learn don't earn I believe that you have to be obsessed with your high income skill you know
for me it was writing code I would do everything from build apps for my friends to share photos online to
build an application for people to download and create burnt CDs of all their top MP3s yes I'm dating
myself to build websites for my dad so that he could share his Cottage I just use the skill as often as
possible possible it was just something I offered for free so that I could learn it wasn't about making
money so if I was starting over again knowing what I know today here's exactly how I would do it the
first thing is I would get somebody a result as fast as possible whatever skill you want to develop find
somebody that's got the problem that you can provide a solution and get them a result as fast as
possible do the work ahead of time every day I get people messaging me hey I could edit your videos
or hey I could sell for you or hey I can write code for one of your businesses and I'm like just do it show
me you can do the thing ahead of time don't ask me to pay you to show me you can do it it's the folks
that show up and just do it that are going to get the opportunity then once you actually get them a result
ask them for the testimonial that's how we start to build your portfolio once you have two or three or four
of these then I can ask for one or two referrals from those people to recommend my work to somebody
else that they might know that they appreciate or trust and then I would continue to learn and collect
feedback on how I can become better if I do that right then I'm going to increase my pace of learning
not necessarily earning but it's going to create a flywheel to catapult me forward which brings us to
month three which is to get your first client so the first thing that ever got paid for that wasn't a family
member that gave me money to help solve a problem was literally these burnt CDs that would have all
the person's favorite MP3 songs on I built this app where they could create their playlist and then
Page 72
request that cdb burnt so they could have it and put it in their cars again you may not be aware but
there used to be physical devices that people put songs on to play in their car I did the first one for free
to give them a test to say hey here's how it works and then they loved it and then after that then I would
charge them for ongoing CDs if they wanted to build a new playlist they wanted to create something for
the girlfriend or their boyfriend and that to me is one of the best ways to get your first client is
demonstrate the value ahead of time and then once they're in then ask them to pay you for followon
work ask them to pay you to do more when you charge for your work the whole relationship changes I
mean their expectations are higher which isn't a bad thing you actually get paid so you can invest in
yourself and buy tools to make yourself even better the other thing you'll learn real quick is that if
people don't pay they don't pay attention meaning that if what you do as a service requires them to give
you feedback if they're not paying don't be upset if their emails don't get responded very quickly the
more they pay the more they pay attention so you'll be able to do better and better work the more you
can charge somebody because the client will want the result even more which brings us to month four
which is to build your marketing pipeline which are the four Ps of demand generation don't be the
world's best kept secret your goal is to get as many people as possible to know about you what you do
and how you can help them see back in the day it used to be about going to speaking at events or
getting covered in the local newspaper maybe getting covered by the local blog today you want to get
your reach out there to the world go on podcast do collaborations with other influencers go and create
webinars or joint webinars so that you can take advantage of other people's audiences top of funnel is
more important than anything else you can't sell to an empty room so ask yourself who's got your
perfect fit customers when you think about the person that you know you create the most value for as
fast as possible that is most likely to easily pay that is the person that you want to talk to who's got a
room full of those people that have a need to solve the problem that you can solve for them reach out to
them go on their podcast ask to contribute a Blog Post article do a joint webinar if you do those things
you will build the top of funnel so there's only four Ps to create demand in the market the first p is
publishing than social media content we want to use education-based marketing to inform our
customers how they can solve the problems themselves but if we do a good job showing them how to
do that they're going to go well this person is clearly an expert SEO blog post those are all in the
publishing realm the second p is paid Facebook I love paid cuz it's fast paid allows you to literally create
a target audience on these platforms to get an ad placed in front of them so that people respond that
are perfect fit for your product the third p is Partners these are people that have an audience a built-in
room where you can get in front of sometimes they're called affiliate sometimes they're called strategic
Partners sometimes they're called value added resellers the end of the day they're people that you
partner with to get in front of their audience the fourth is PR this is public relations this is getting
interviewed on a podcast anytime that somebody reaches out to you and they have a platform they
interview you around your story how you help people What Makes You Different that is PR those 4 PS
are the top of funnel of creating awareness so that everybody knows about what you do and how you
do it and who you do it for so they can refer a lot of people to you which brings us to month five which is
to hire an assistant and the ATF framework to make it work see back in the day when I started my first
company I used to spend all my time doing all the work even to the point that every Sunday I would go
into my office just to sort the physical mail that would come into the PO box and I would spend hours
just looking at every envelope and letter and sorting them between things I had to go to my lawyer
things I have to go to my accountant things I got to get processed later and I realized that I was
spending all this time doing something that any other person could do and I found a woman named Lisa
and I just taught her in person how to process my mail and all of a sudden I had hours back on a
Sunday so instead of processing mail I was doing lead generation I was doing follow-up on my sales
funnel I Was preparing for the week I was reviewing applications and references and postings like I was
doing things that were actually growing my business so if you spend all of your time doing things that
somebody else could do instead of working on the thing that makes you the most money you're
essentially working against yourself this is the first hire and what I call the replacement ladder see most
entrepreneurs end up building a business they grow to hate so we use the ATF framework which
stands for audit transfer and fill to make sure that we look at our calendar for where we're spending our
time take the things that cost very little that we hate doing for me anything finan ancial or not very fun
Page 73
process oriented and then T is transfer transferring that to somebody else that literally plays at the thing
you work at that you could pay little money and then you take that new found time and you fill that's the
F learning new skills character traits belief systems or just doing more of the work that you're getting
paid to do if you can follow the ATF framework and get your assistant to take over most of the stuff in
your calendar that isn't working with clients directly you will end up making more money as fast as
possible if you want my internal playbook for how I work with my assistant and see the 47 pages of my
sop standard operating procedure just find me on Instagram at Dam martel2 Martell and message me
YouTube EA for executive assistant and I will send you my direct link to my Google doc no gated you
don't have to give me your email or your cell phone number and it walks you through exactly how I work
with my executive assistants to buy back literally 40 plus hours a week which brings us to month 6 and
we're halfway there with which is to master sales see in the early days of building my first company that
finally made money called spheric Technologies I realized that I wasn't very good at selling world class
at writing code really good at hiring other Engineers but when it came to talking to normal people and
trying to get them to buy from me I used to get nervous I didn't know what to say they would ask for
things I would just say yes and I would get dragged Along on this long sales process of people that
were never intending to buy in the first place but learning the Mastery of sales became my new passion
so learning how to code was my first High income skill but then realizing that if I really wanted to grow I
had to get really good at communicating in sales that's when I started investing and learning that new
skill set I learned a long time ago that a business is started it's birth only when money exchanges hands
so if you think about it nothing really happens unless somebody sells something and I think about it less
about selling trying to get somebody to make a decision they don't want to make and more about
enrolling them into my world my service my product want to teach you a powerful framework called the
buying pocket see what I've learned over the years is sometimes you're talking to somebody and they
just don't even believe it's possible you know they have no confidence in their ability the opportunity
they're just on this side of the spectrum and they're wondering like can I even do this I've heard people
do it and I don't know if I can do it the other side is you know people that are overconfident where they
think that they don't need your help that they you know they're listening to what you got to say but
they're like yeah these are all things I know and I can do it myself the challenges is most sales people
are never taught the questions to reframe the situation to get person to buy so for example if
somebody's underconfidence I might say well how much revenue would you need to be making to feel
really proud of yourself and they say well honestly maybe 10K a month and you're like oh yeah for sure
I mean we have 700 clients that do 10K a month learning our strategies and then somebody else that
might be really confident you might ask them well how much are you currently making now and they're
like oh I'm making 100,000 a year and you might say oh wow that's it depending on the conversation
you have to bring the buyer into the pocket where they're able to make a decision because they're not
underconfidence they're not overconfident in their abilities they're right in the perfect pocket which
brings us to month 7 which is a hire somebody to help you deliver your product or service to your
customer a lot of people get busy doing the thing that they sold so the more they sell the more they got
to do and if they have the opportunity to double maybe triple the business over the next few months
May means their calendar is going to get double or triple more and then when they have these
opportunities instead of pushing on the gas they push on the break cuz they don't want to end up
creating all this emotional shrapnel around them from their team their family or their friends they never
see them anymore so I want to teach you how to hire somebody to offload that work and support you in
delivering for the customer so this is the second hire in my framework the replacement ladder
essentially everything from customer support to customer success to support tickets to product support
setting up a customer intake after the sales conversation happens and you get a credit card the person
shows up and you have them deal with every aspect of the customer experience you might still be
involved in doing the work but you have this person help you in delivering that value so you're not the
one trying to coordinate in your calendar they are they're the ones pulling the reports together so that
when you have your weekly meeting with your customers you can show them how you're doing having
somebody else that's responsible for everything that's involved in delivering your product or service so
that you can buy back that time is huge leverage that you can then reinvest and either doing more work
to you can make more money or increasing your skills so that you become more valuable which brings
Page 74
us to month 8 which is to hire somebody to help you with marketing one time I had this friend named
Rachel and she had a marketing agency and she would do everything she had to to get customers she
get busy marketing posting on social media asking for referrals then she would get all these clients she
would get busy she' probably do the work for three or four or five months and then she wouldn't do any
marketing all the revenue would go away and one day she came to me and she said what do I do to
grow my business and I go well you have to be consistent in marketing if you're inconsistent then you're
always trying to fill up your calendar instead of adding to it so that's why it's the third line in the
replacement ladder is to have somebody that wakes up every day dedicated to generating leads for
your business so you want to have somebody else that looks at the campaigns that looks at the traffic
sources that looks at the conversions to make sure that you're getting new leads every single day now
you might still be involved in the marketing meaning that they're going to ask you to post on social
media or shoot videos that they post on your YouTube or maybe even write the newsletter that you're
sending out to all of your prospects but they're responsible for ensuring that whole machine continues
to happen every day every week so that on a monthly basis you're consistent in your ability to generate
leads which brings us to month n which is to join a coaching program now I know for a lot of people
they're like oh another they're coach I can't believe you're talking about this here's the deal the fastest
way for you to get to a destination is to ask somebody that's been there before and I put this off for
years I remember I was 23 years old two failed companies until finally out of desperation I read a book
and realize I need to hire a coach that teaches me the Frameworks that I just read in this book so I
hired my first coach named Bob and he was not cheap 1,500 bucks a month for two phone calls
American dollars I'm Canadian that's like real money but in the next year I went from barely making
payroll not knowing what I was doing to making almost a million in my first year as an entrepreneur so
my whole philosophy is if you want to learn the fastest and grow the fastest then get into a coaching
program with somebody for your specific High income skill that's going to allow you to grow as fast as
possible there are people out there that are already making a million dollars a month in the thing you're
doing if you pay to be in their Community learn their Frameworks their process their strategies you'll be
able to shortcut your success and literally compress decades into days go search on on YouTube the
specific problems you're having in your business and add your industry as a term to that search and
those videos are typically from people that have other ways they can help it might be one-on-one
private coaching it might be semi-private with small group coaching it might be a big group coaching it
might even be an online course but at the end of the day having somebody who's been there that gives
you the blueprints and the steps to get there faster this is the fastest way for you to go from broke to
millionaire business owner which brings us to month 10 which is to hire sales I have had to learn the
skill of selling early in my career and move on to hiring other salespeople but the funniest person I ever
hired was this guy named Michael when I started coaching other people I wanted somebody else to
help me buy back my time cuz my wife was like yo why are you on phone calls all the time the referrals
were crazy and I was like well I'm you know try to talk to the people they want to work with me so I
figure it's a good opportunity for me to see if there's a fit but she's like shouldn't you take your own
advice and I'm like H okay so I went and I hired a guy his name was Michael and he came in and I
didn't know how to sell coaching I just said hey man you should talk to these people I've got a calendar
full of people that want to work with me just listen to my previous calls and sell but the truth is is I didn't
have High Hopes I mean this person was selling swords on the internet he had never sold coaching
before and all he did was listen to my calls and within the first day he had somebody pull out this credit
card and buy on the call within 30 minutes and I freaked out I was like dude what did you say is this
person expecting to come to my house for dinner tonight or that I've got to you know spend the next 6
weeks with them how did you get the person to purchase in 30 minutes he said I just followed your
process I was like what process he's like I listened to your calls I mapped out exactly kind of what I was
seeing you doing and I just walked them through it and here's the crazy part most people don't
understand this as entrepreneurs is that when you actually have somebody else selling for you it makes
you look better as the owner because the person buying goes oh well if they have a system for this they
probably a system for delivering the thing I need which means I have a higher likely of a guaranteed
outcome then if I'm talking to the CEO of the business that's also going to be doing the work like when
do they have time to actually take care of the projects that they're going to be doing for me this is the
Page 75
fourth hire in the replacement ladder is sales and I want you to train this person to enroll people into
your product or service and the best way to do that is to record yourself doing the calls doing the sales
even the emails the follow-up like document all of it and then when you hire the person give them those
leads and say just follow this process the is is they need to Own 100% of the initial conversations and
100% of the follow-ups if you have somebody else taking the calls the sales opportunities the leads the
referrals that come into you even if it's a best friend it's like hey I've got this opportunity I want you to
talk to my friend John you say yeah no problem I'll connect him with Mike Mike does all the initial calls
with our new clients he's been with me for a while he's incredible he'd love to talk with your friend that
way you're not the bottleneck and here's a crazy cool part about this if you look at the replacement
ladder now with only four hires okay somebody to help you on the administrative stuff to the you know
delivery of the thing you sell to the marketing of what you're selling to the sales of what you're selling
you can now go on vacation you could be sleeping and your business will still make money it might not
continue to function without you because you're still involved in the doing of the work but while you're
on vacation somebody else is making sure your name's getting out there in the market they're having
the conversation with those people interested and then they're onboarding those customers into your
product or service while you you are away which is the Holy Grail of Entrepreneurship and getting to a
million dollars that nobody talks about that is very simple if you focus on those four hires which brings
us to month 11 which is the hire leadership this is where you want to start hiring people to actually run
the operations of the business you still might be involved in writing the copy or doing sales for different
businesses but you want to hire somebody that can look at the overall system and continue to run
things as fast as possible so for example when I started my new Media Company tell media one of the
first hires I made was a guy named Todd and Todd came in as my general manager and as we started
to put the pieces in place and things had to get done it got routed to Todd now Todd is somebody who's
done this for decades and he knows how the playbooks work so it was really easy for me to just give it
to them and a lot of you have some of those people in your life but you're scared to let go the reality is if
you don't learn to let go then you'll always be a prisoner to your business and if you want to get to a
million as fast as possible you need to learn how to work through people to get projects completed
where you're not involved they focus on hiring and training and retaining your top talent so that you get
to focus on what's next you get to focus on your creative juices and trying to like figure out how do I get
in front of more people how do we scale our sales process how do we make sure that the delivery of
what we do is so worldclass that every one of our customers is referring other people to our business
that is how you build the replacement ladder so that you can get to a million in the in the first year which
brings us to month 12 which is to build your personal brand every one of your dreams your goals your
vision for your life gets easier will come to life on the back end of people knowing who you are and how
you can help them I've been online creating content for 15 years I have millions of followers across
different platforms but I started with zero and it doesn't matter where you're at today you're going to
have to start at the exact same place I did what benefit you have is you have folks like me and many
others literally un packing the blueprint for you to follow to build your audience as fast as humanly
possible and the key is is you want to focus on channels where you would love to express yourself
through so if you're more of a video person create video if you like to write go blog if you want to teach
maybe it's joint webinars with other people's audiences so you can build your personal brand and then
what you do is you capture all that and you just slice it up and repurposing all these different channels I
know for me when I was building out SAS Academy the ad cost cut in half when we started doubling
down on our video production the more people that could search and get results in advance because
we created educational based content that helped us prove that we were a trusted advisor in our
market and the same thing works for you education-based marketing is the best way for you to build
your personal brand and also help a lot of people My Philosophy is this if you do it right your marketing
will help more people than your product or service ever will and your personal brand allows you to
demonstrate who you you are your personality as well as your skill set and your expertise so people
can trust you before they ever buy from you so it even makes the engagement of working with them
way easier see most people mess this up because they try to do all platforms at once just pick one if it's
Instagram if it's LinkedIn if it's Twitter just do something and be consistent because consistency
compounds and what matters more is that you show up every day adding value to the market than
Page 76
anybody else in their world to demonst that you're the kind of person that could be trusted with their
project or to help them solve that problem that's what I do if I wanted to go from broke to millionaire
business owner but if you want to learn my 17 rules of success click the link and I'll see
