The First Free AI Agent Builder is Here and it's Powerful
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE2tjGBvsF4
there's a brand new AI agent Builder where you could build custom AI agents with very specific set of
instructions completely for free and I want to show you exactly how to use it in this video if you come to
this website right here chat. mol. mistol is a large language model is by a French startup and is free to
use this chatbot is free to use and it's powered by a large language model right now called mistro Larch
2 that's one of the models they have they have other models but this is the best one available right now
what they just released is this option right here agents so if you click over here it brings you to this page
where you could create yourself custom agents and these agents could be powered by different AI
models that mistol has so again mistol large 2 is one of them now what are these agents exactly right
now in the world of AI we have two very popular AI agent Builders one is called custom gpts so if you
go to chat GPT this is one that I've built myself in order to build them inside of chat GPT you need a
paid version of chat GPT for $20 a month and you could build as many custom agents or custom gpts
as you want so this one I'll show you in a second we'll use for this video the other option you have is
from cloud so cloud. a another chatbot and here you could also build these things called projects so
with projects you could again build something that's very specific and with its own set of instructions
these are really designed for very specific tasks that's why they're called AI agents that's what they call
them in mistol and this is a third version of that so you have an option I've made ton of videos
comparing custom gpts and the reason why I make many videos about that is because I think these AI
agents or custom gpts are the best parts right now in the world of AI I use them more than any other
tool and I've literally test that out about a thousand different AI tools so let's go ahead and finish building
this agent again pick your model I recommend large 2 this temperature option has been around if
you've ever done anything more customized but the higher you go this goes all the way to one or you
could bring it all the way to zero and typically somewhere in the middle is where you want to be now the
closer to zero you go the less random your output is going to be and then if you go all the way towards
one it's going to be a lot random a lot more creative so you could just hover over lower value makes
results more predictable so the fact that we have this slider this temperature slider here to control
Randomness something we don't have anywhere else unless it's more customized things that are more
advanced for developers then you have your instructions where you could type in a system prompt so a
system prompt is something that you could give to chat GPT for example at the account level it's a
custom instruction for the specific bot that I'm building this AI agent is going to have a very specific
system prompt when you're using chat GPT if you're just regularly using it you don't really know know
how they prompted to talk to you in a specific way here when you design these little agents you could
get each one to be different than another one not just like a broad chat GPT or broad mistol so I buil
this custom GPT and it's available for free because you could build custom GPT and share it with
people without a paid version they could use it completely free so here you could type in a basic prompt
and I'll link this in the description and it will generate a custom instruction that I could paste over there
and I'll type in something simple so my instruction is turn a single sentence into a LinkedIn post and this
is going to create a much more interesting prompt you are an AI model designed to transform a single
sentence into a professional LinkedIn post so this is creating the prompt this is your little prompt
designer here I'll go ahead and copy this right here and let's go ahead and back to our agent Builder
and type in our system prompt over here which by the way is optional but the point of these is that you
give it a system prompt so it follows your very specific set of instructions talks to you in a certain way
you could give it a tone you could give it a writing style you could give it a reading level all that could be
part of your custom instructions again I've made ton of videos on this channel about how custom
instructions work now this is one of my favorite prompting techniques and it's available here as an
option it's called fuse shot prompting so with fuse shot prompting you could give the model an example
so you could tell that hey when someone puts this input this is the ideal output that I want so if you click
this it says what's the input and what's the output that you desire so here's an example so this agent the
purpose of this agent is I could give it a simple one- sentence LinkedIn post and it will give me
Page 1
something far more detailed so that's what the instructions I give it so I need to give it an example for
input so let's say if a post I was going to make just said AI education is crucial for preparing students for
tomorrow's jobs H it's okay right I wouldn't probably post that on LinkedIn so what would the output look
like if I was giving this chatbot an example it's learning from a very specific example and you could give
it more than one so I could give it something like this that's far more detailed here let me go ahead and
extend this out a bit AI is becoming a big part of our world and teaching it well is the key for getting
students ready for the future careers and there's a bunch more here right and all I have to do is if I give
it an example of the input and write the output that's a lot more detailed is more customized to my
writing style it's going to use that as it set of instructions to give us an answer and I usually like to give it
one or two examples like this when I have this options for demonstration before when I was teaching
Claude in the project settings or if I was building custom gpts I will still give it this input and output
example because few shot prompting is a great way to give instructions to these chat Bots but I was
doing that as part of the system prompt now it has a different section for it inside of this mistal agent
Builder and that's pretty much all I have to do and then I could go ahead and name this agent on top
LinkedIn post generator and I could press deploy right here and for my deployment it lets you do it
through the API again that's for developers but in our case we're just going to put Le chat this is their
chat bot over here so I'm going to deploy it there now let me just point out the pricing here because if
you deploy your agent if you just press deploy here you could use it for free inside of their chats so
inside of that first website I showed you you could pick it which I'll show you exactly how to find it and
use it totally for free custom gpts can't be built and used for free you have to pay for them to build them
clot projects you have to pay to build them here you could build them and use them for free the only
time you may want to pay is if you want to use their API so if you're building some kind of AI app using
this then you'll need to pay because API is pay as you go and you will have to pay for that or if you want
to test it out while you're building it on the right side is letting you test it out that requires a subscription
but it's not a flat rate it's pay as you go and I'll set that up in this video as well but for most of you you
could go ahead and build this AI agent you could go ahead and deploy it you could share it with other
people and you could use it all for free and in order to do any testing with it by the way it says it's great
out right here because we need to set up a subscription so let me show you exactly how that works if
you decide to go this route this does have a free trial again I don't know if this is available in every
country but over here I could go ahead and activate it or or I could just press subscribe over here and
the pricing is based on what model you choose in the very beginning so some of them are very cheap
like some of these older models are very cheap but if you use mistro large 2 you could see this one
right here is $3 per million tokens on the input side $9 on the output side just to compare this with gp4
for example it's slightly cheaper it's I think about half of GPT 4's newer model somewhere around there
but it's not that far off okay so just so you have some idea if you were using the API on the GPT side
now if I go back to the chat interface here any agent I build by the way is going to appear just like this
and I could build other ones here and over here I could just type in this again would be a simple
LinkedIn post and then I could go ahead and send this out and it should use my set of instructions I give
it for this very specific task and as you could see this was the LinkedIn post that I would have written
and it's making it again much more comprehensive based on my set of instruction and based on that
few shot prompting which was given an input example and an output example and wow this is pretty
involved here but it looks like a linked impost right something like this would probably get a lot more
engagement than something that's just a simple one sentence a great way to optimize anything and I
usually like to use these AI chat Bots for exactly this purpose to remix content to take simple content
make it much better and I use this across all the different social medias that I post to or even for
newsletters and email copy too and I recently made a video comparing Claud projects to custom gpts
too so those are your two other options this was a new one that I wanted to add to the mix but I
recommend you watch that next some of those have better options that this doesn't have including a
way to upload your own documents as part of your GPT your own knowledge base chat GPT could do
that clot projects could do that this cannot do that yet which is a big big limitation that hopefully they
improve on but I hope you found this useful and I will see you on the next video
