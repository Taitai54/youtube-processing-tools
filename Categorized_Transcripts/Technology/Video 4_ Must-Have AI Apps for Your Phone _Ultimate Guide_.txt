Must-Have AI Apps for Your Phone (Ultimate Guide)

a lot of the AI tools and innovations that make the headlines involve being at a computer but you can
use AI for all those same incredible things across endless use cases all right on your phone some of
these apps I've been using daily for months but I also filled my phone up with more apps that I tested
for this I'll give the best free and paid options for every category it's mostly free I'll start with the most
popular of all I'm sure most people watching have used chat GPT before so I'll skip the basics and
just show a few cool use cases specifically as they apply to mobile a vis was a huge game changer
which I use all the time you can upload any image and it will know what's in the image and you can
ask questions about it like this morning when I was taking the trash to the curb I guess it's more of a
snow pile than a curb [Music] now or I forgot the species of a house plant that we have or when you
need to replace something in your car or fix something around the house instead of finding a
YouTube video you can go back and forth with chat GPT now those are just some everyday
examples it can do much more complex things like upload a drawing of a website idea and it will
generate the code for it can recognize food dishes then create a recipe all sorts of stuff it is
incredibly helpful another feature that I use only on mobile is voice chat you can tap right here and
then speak your question I started a disco Metal Fusion band what should we be called Mirror Ball
Mayhem would be a great name for your disco Metal Fusion band you can also use dolly3 one of the
highest quality image generators right within voice chat create our first album cover that is amazing
GPT 4 vision and Dolly 3 are only available with chat GPT plus which is $20 a month but there is a
way to use all of those for free the Microsoft co-pilot launched their mobile app recently I'm on the
free plan and as you can see here I can switch to GPT 4 I can take a picture of that same house plant
with vision and and it gets the same answer I can create images with Dolly 3 a secret society of
anthropomorphic barn owls wearing cult robes performing secret disco rituals aspect ratio 169 there is
voice input and it even has an option chat gbt plus doesn't have this plugin called suo to create music
so let's create a song for that disco Metal Fusion band it'll be about a secret society of barn owls all
right so while that's generating if we're just comparing the free plans co-pilot wins easily the main
benefits of chat GPT plus are it is much faster and remembers your conversation better it can handle
larger documents can do data analysis and you can build your own custom gpts I find it to be worth it
because I use those additional features all the time and the extra speed is really nice but for casual
users it is probably not worth paying the $20 per month over using co-pilot for free let's listen to this it
actually only took a few seconds to generate the [Music] together oh I'm going to stop it right there is
just too good I'm going to use some of the tools we'll get to later and turn this into a full music video
This always seems to happen another llm I'll mention here is character AI if you want a more fun
experience it's a chat bot where you can select from all sorts of different personalities to chat with I
personally had never use this one but it is the second most visited AI tool almost 500 million visits per
month you can't really argue with those numbers so I had to give it a try there's a big list of characters
to talk to got Einstein Napoleon or there's things like a dating coach or tutor you can also create your
own character to chat with or start a group chat I feel like talking to gigachad someone told me I look
just like [Music] you that's the spirit with the right attitude you will be unstoppable you are a winner I
did that face swap all on mobile the photo and video tools are super fun we'll get to those later one
more I really like that's kind of in this category is perplexity so how I use perplexity and think about it is
essentially as the best replacement of Google instead of just a list of links it gives you direct answers
with sources for further reading then you can ask questions for clarification which website can I use to
find the best AI tools and look at that I think this type of conversational search is the future of
searching Google is working on this themselves to compete but right now perplexity is the leader and
they just secured $ 73.6 million in funding so who knows maybe they'll Dethrone Google as the
default Search tool they already have for me I'm going to do a rapid fire through just a whole bunch of
tools across all sorts of use cases they're all super cool they won't each apply to everyone but it's
been just really interesting to research and test out how all this new technology is being applied in
Page 17
different areas Socratic is a Homework Helper by Google you can take a picture of any homework
question and it will show you the answer but also how to get there yourself so so it's a really fast and
easy personal tutor that works across all subjects and I'm sure there's no one out there using this for
any reasons other than as a tutor if you make a lot of voice notes whisper memos is great you speak
into it then it will use AI to transcribe and format your note into paragraphs to make it easier to read
then it will email it to you we'll also add a relevant Emoji to help jog your memory of what you were
talking about in a similar realm but more comprehensive is otter an AI meeting assistant it can record
and transcribe your meetings in person or on Zoom Google meet and Microsoft teams then you can
search the text to play back the audio at adjustable speeds then tap the words to jump to different
spots uh can highlight key points to review later has automated slide capture it will insert into the
notes this works in the mobile app and also has a web version it's really helpful if you have a lot of
meetings although some of these companies are starting to implement similar technology natively
into their platforms du lingo has been one of the best language learning apps for a long time and
they've Incorporated AI it is a paid add-on but adds some really useful features like explain my
answer if you get something wrong or right you can jump into a conversation to understand more
specifics there's also roleplay where you'll speak in real time to the AI it generates the conversation
as you speak so it will be a different experience each time after the interaction you get AI powered
feedback from duo with tips for future conversations this is huge you used to have to go out and find a
native speaker to practice with which you should definitely still do when you can humans are pretty
cool too but that's not always an option another in the language realm is Elsa an AI tutor for
non-native English speakers so you input your native language and it will use its speech recognition
to help improve pronunciation and offer alternative phrasings can also roleplay conversations to help
prepare and offer feedback being able to detect the subtleties of different accents and offer feedback
is pretty incredible to me seeing AI is a free app from Microsoft to help people with vision impairment
so it uses the camera to identify people and objects and describe them audibly that can help with
reading describing photos identifying products saving people's faces so you can recognize them
really cool stuff we've hit the first Waypoint let's look with the camera left and right and we can hear
the location of the next Waypoint let's keep going there's another one Google Maps has some new AI
features rolling out they're really cool but only available in these 15 cities right now so I'll cover it
quickly imersive view lets you explore locations in 3D instead of the 360 panoramas in street view it's
much more well immersive you can click on time and weather and see what it will look like at different
times throughout the day it's really great to see what a route will look like before your trip as well and
I'm sure it will take some time before that's integrated everywhere yuper is an app for mental health
it's essentially a chat bot that uses cognitive behavioral therapy to track your moods thoughts and
feelings and also provide interactive exercises to help them improve this one isn't something I've used
but it has good reviews and something to look into if that sounds interesting to you I think AI has a
lot of potential in the areas of mental and physical health it may not be there yet but will be far more
accessible than traditional forms of therapy and quite possibly Superior speechify is the best text to
speech app I tried it works for PDFs web pages text messages emails handwritten notes just all sorts
of text it has a bunch of pre-programmed voices including celebrities so you could take a picture of a
page and have Snoop Dog read it to [Music] you the Mind adapts and converts to its own purposes
the obstacle to our acting the imped to action advances action what stands in the way becomes the
way move AI is a really easy way to do motion capture it captures all the 3D data right from your
phone which you can export to use for 3D animation and something like blender I mean that part
wouldn't be on mobile but is also free Luma Labs is one of my favorites on this entire list you can
create 3D captures of any scene right from a free app on your phone it's really easy to use you either
capture the scene with the instructions in the app or take a video with the normal camera app walking
through your scene or around your sub object right then just upload it and let it render once it's done
you can navigate through the scene right on your phone or send it to a friend for them to explore so
it's super easy you can go deeper than that if you want and create custom camera movements with
key frames to fly around the scene and make it look like a drone shot without using a drone there's
just Endless Possibilities with this I'll be combining it with some other tools a little later with inv video
you can create entire videos with a voice over stock video clips music and transitions all from a text
Page 18
prompt and they recently released their mobile app which made them the perfect sponsor for this
video so I'll jump right in here and create a video I just log in and start writing my prompt let's make
an engaging 45C video about the top five most dangerous animals and an awesome feature they
added here is you can upload a 30second clip of your own voice and it will clone it sometimes AI
voices can sound a bit generic uploading your own can make it sound more natural it asks for the
audience the look and feel and the platform these all look good then it starts editing and in under a
minute we have the finished video Welcome to the perilous world of Nature's most dangerous
creatures at number five we've got the Fearsome saltwater crocodile this looks solid but we can edit
it further if needed through conversation I want the first clip to be a little more intense welcome to the
perilous world of Nature's Most right that looks great I'll just add some captions too you can also edit
the scenes or script man ually so let's switch out one of these clips about a crocodile biting I went
through these some of them were probably too intense to throw in here so I'll just add this one
walking now when we go to export we have a few options to remove the water marks which you'll
want to do if you're posting this anywhere they have different paid options to upgrade to that gives
you access to the voice clowning as well let's check this whole video out welcome to the perilous
world of Nature's most dangerous creatures at number five we've got the Fearsome saltwater
crocodile a living Relic with a bite force unparalleled slithering in at four we find the venomous inland
taipan whose lethal cocktail can take down 100 men at three we have the stealthy box jellyfish a
translucent Terror that packs a lethal sting taking the second spot is the Majestic African elephant a
gentle giant until provoked and Topping our list the microscopic mosquito an unassuming Menace
responsible for millions of deaths annually remember respect Nature's power and tread lightly all that
in just a couple minutes from from a text prompt you can try nid out for free on the app or the website
I'll link to both below and thank you so much to Nido for sponsoring this video now on to images this is
the section I downloaded the most apps to test for I picked the best for a few different uses first is
image generation there's a ton of options out there my allaround favorite that has just a really robust
free plan is star AI there's all sorts of different styles to choose from they make it really easy to
explore and get inspiration you can open a category to see different Generations it does just a great
job with creative or abstract stuff but also photo realism so let's check out photography I can do very
realistic people which is a struggle for a lot of the other mobile image generators this one looks
interesting so I'll open that up and it will show The Prompt and style that was used and other similar
Creations below I'll remix this one as is just for the ease of demonstration then that was done pretty
quick and I have four options those look really cool you could also explore by style instead of
category you can even upload a set of images to train your own style there's also options for
uploading an image or a sketch as input you get five credits per day for free which generate four
Images each so 20 images per day and as long as you click the button to claim each day they build
up in your account so if you remember to do that you can end up with a lot pretty quick at $7.99 per
month to upgrade another similar one I want to mention quickly is wonder I preferred the generations
and ux from Star but Wonder has these cool illusion Styles which are really fun you can can transform
your face into different scenes or you could use it with patterns like the spirals that went viral a while
back or logos or text I assume they're using illusion diffusion under the hood but they make it really
easy to jump in and use and you get five free per day if you want an AI Avatar of yourself there's other
apps out there that you can train on your face by uploading a bunch of images the app that started
the whole Avatar trend is lenza and from what I tried it still seems to be one of the best at this that's
actually the app I created my profile picture with when I started this Chann Channel although I would
do it custom now you click magic avatars select your gender then select up to 10 different styles then
you'll upload 10 to 20 selfies it's $7.99 for 56 avatars $1.99 for5 then you let it generate here's what
mine came back with they're pretty solid and look a lot more like me than any of the free options I
tried that's what made lenso really popular they also have some other features for touching up photos
focusing on portraits and selfies but an app I tried that's even better at that is called face tune it can
do things like smooth skin change eye color reshape your face if you have a need for that sort of thing
it was actually pretty crazy how easy and good it was at that the best free face swap I've found is in
Discord as I've discovered in the comment sections of previous videos there's a big chunk of people
that just hate Discord which is understandable so I'll cover it quick so you can see how it works I have
Page 19
an entire video on how to use it if you think it looks cool the link in the description on this one will be to
invite the bot to a server once it's there you use the command save ID to upload your face once it's
saved any image you upload in Discord or generate with mid Journey you can hold down on it then
select apps then click in swapper now it switches it out with my face I know that was super fast watch
the full video I have on it if you want to learn that there were lots of paid apps for face swapping you
get 50 credits per day for free with this one if you don't mind Discord and moving on to the most
impressive category of all and another extremely difficult one to research and narrow down video
tools did is the best mobile app I've seen for making talking avatars it is paid though this is what I
used to make that clip in the beginning so I'll take the face swap of me and gigachad and I'll add a
script of the response it gave me in character AI then select a voice that's the spirit then you can
select an emotion that's the spirit that's the spirit that's the spirit that's the spirit that's the spirit and let
it generate it's easy as that I don't have much need for this Beyond random little meme videos every
once in a while but it's fun that's the spirit with the right attitude you will be unstoppable be kind to
others and let nothing in your way you are a winner kyber is another one of my personal favorites
there's a lot you can do with it you can do text a video image to video and video to video I used it to
make a music video in a previous video that was with the flip book style you can storyboard out the
whole video to transform it into different scenes and sync it up to music since I used that last time I'll
do the motion Style this time you could upload an image to start with but I'm just going to use text
stick with that owl theme then you can choose one of their preset Styles or come up with your own
then choose an aspect ratio now you can choose the length and how much it will evolve throughout
the clip then [Music] generate that's actually pretty solid for a first try kyber is definitely better with
things that are more animated and not photo realistic now I also want to use the video to video to
edit a scene I got with Luma Labs I'll show what I did in Luma Labs I actually just clicked oscillate to
make it go in a circle and just kept a couple of the key frames I'm going to take that and I want to
make it look like it's spinning through the wall into different scenes so in kyber I just click transform
and then upload the video for the prompt I'll just do a man leaning against a wall in a forest I'll use one
of their pre-made Styles I'll try 3D rendering then move on to settings I'm going to bump the transform
up to 9 this next screen will have some thumbnails to choose from to give you an idea of what it will
look like now [Music] generate and that looks awesome I'm going to do the same thing a few more
times I'll try underwater on fire and in space I'll test out a few of the other styles too right made a
bunch of those and now I will edit the whole thing together in cap cut that's my go-to mobile video
editor it's just really easy to use and they have added in a lot of AI features as well this will be a pretty
basic edit though I just need to upload all the clips and really just put them next to each [Music] other
Runway also does text to video image to video and video to video but does them very differently than
Kyper I use Dolly to generate a bunch of images of the secret barn owl disco cult now I'm going to
animate them all with Runway I'll click Gen 2 and upload an image then there's a few options in here
I'll start with the easiest where I just write a simple prompt and let it generate and while it's working I'll
pull up a different image and this time I'll enter directors mode we have all sorts of options I'll start
with motion brush I want the disco ball to be raising up to this position so I'll paint over it with the
brush then I'm going to have it move down from here and play the clip in Reverse you can use
multiple brushes to add completely different types of motion to different parts of your image this is
how would do that um I only really need one for this so I'll delete those now I'll switch to camera
controls they give you full control here as well I'll just add a zoom out but they've got all these pans
and tilts too that's what I like about Runway they put a lot of effort into giving you creative control over
your Generations instead of just click a couple buttons and see what happens let's take a look at that
first clip that worked out pretty well and what I'll typically do is generate a bunch of times and then
pick the best option let's check out that other one that looks great I have a ton of images to go through
then all I'll edit it all together in cap cut on mobile so every part of this will be done on my phone the
song using Theo plug-in and co-pilot Dolly 3 for the images Runway to animate them then cap cut to
put it all together [Music] togethering with of ready to about dance fire me out [Music] tonight the [Music]
moon I think that turned out pretty awesome I don't know if I'll ever be able to top the Frog cyborg
music video I'll have a link to the video that was in on the screen here if you didn't see that one and
