Forget Prompting They Pay $510,000 for This Now...

it's up to half a million I know what do you think of that first things first I'm probably gonna in this video I
sat down with Joseph rosenal Joe has been focusing for more than a year on meta prompting the field
of prompt engineering for which in Tropic the creators of Claude model one of the most capable AI
models out there today they're offering up to half a million dollars uh as I'm editing this video on tropic
change the title of a job description and I know that this is still the same job post because I still have all
my highlights and now still the price is the same so it's not just meta prompting it's prompting in general
now we explain what is meta prompting we discuss an Tropic decision to invest in research and prompt
engineering and of course we'll look at his job position in Greater detail I found met prompting position
please don't apply we need you at snph mindes you don't want me a spy in anthropic no but I would like
to go through it how feasible it is because it's up to half a million I know what do you think of that first
things first I'm probably gonna apply it's wild that is a wild annual salary for a meta prompting engineer
granted like we'll go through the responsibilities and the knowledge and whatever you look at open AI
for example there's that article where the machine learning Engineers are getting close to a million
bucks a year at the race for talent is incredibly Cutthroat right now and so they are looking for a very
specialized person someone who is very good at prompt engineering but also is very good at coding
and programming and machine learning side of things too it's not as ridiculous maybe as at first glance
if you look at what anthropic did with Claude model and all the series following that with prompt
engineering baking prompting tool directly into clae which is super nice I use it quite often when I'm lazy
on prompting and also helping us to debunk the blackbox that is AI and how does it work investing in
research impr prompt engineers in testing and creating a library of bronze seems like paying off yeah
it's it's a very different model than open AI has been going for especially more recently and in fact Dario
amade the CEO of anthropic was originally at open AI I was really responsible for a lot of the early days
of gpt2 and whatnot uh and didn't feel comfortable staying at open AI because the safety conversation
wasn't at the Forefront and now they really turned the the tables here because not only at least at this
point in time have the most capable model for a pretty good price but they got there by really focusing
on safety first which is what everyone else is cutting Corners around to get the next thing out so it's very
interesting and curious to see how this race continue let's look into this job position before we go
through responsibilities I have some highlights anything that's stood out to you we should probably
Define meta prompting quickly so prompt engineering right you're making prompts to solve a problem
meta prompting is you're making prompts to make your prompts there's lots of research out there that
actually AI is better at prompt engineering than we are which isn't too much of a surprise there so if you
can find the right prompt it can make you all your prompts and in fact at synth Minds we do this all the
time we have several meta prompts that we use like everyone as their favorite meta prompt generator
and really this is about Gathering context from the user based on what you need and then it just
optimizes your prompt to get the outputs that you're looking for yeah and meta prompting we teach that
we've been teaching that for soon a year yeah I remember the first introduction to meta prompting was
there was this Justin fineberg like Tik Tok Instagram video of him coming up with that idea and I was
like that's all I'm going to do now because the most annoying part about prompt engineering is writing
prompts so might as well have ai do like usual 80% of the work and then you add that little extra 20% to
F tune in but way an Tropic kind of defines prompt engineering I find it also interesting it's a hibrid
between research engineering and Behavioral Science what do you think I feel like they're missing one
in there which is linguistic I think that's like probably the main thing everybody who went to study
literacy and people were telling what are you going to dog English degree yeah you speak it why do you
need a degree yeah exactly now you can actually do a lot with that so they're calling this a new
discipline and that it's a range of techniques to systematically discover and document prompting best
practices one part of his job post is developing prompt self-improvement techniques to automatically
organize the model's performance on any given task yeah so that's definitely more than just using a text
just to kind of of BU excitement for people I also find it funny like these type of mistakes where you
Page 101
know that there was something here yeah someone deleted it someone deleted it what we are asking
for people when applying to share a specific prompting model evaluation synthetic data generation
more on that coming uh model fine-tuning or application built with large language models that you
proud of so you should show off complex and clever prompting architecture check or systematic
evaluation of large language Model Behavior and response to different prompts which is funny again
because they're talking about prompt architecture right and it's like what do you mean by that because
again it's are we just talking English right now I guess there is like pseudo code obviously we use
markdown a lot in our prompting I'd be curious to know what how are they thinking about prompt
architecture because at the end of the day it's just like words when you get the interview ask them okay
okay so do you want to take the wheel and dive into responsibilities what stood out to you yeah meta
prompting again we're trying to abstract away prompt engineering as much as we can so this is the
automated prompting techniques they want to fine-tune models and so what that means is that you
have your base model right your foundational model and then you're feeding it extra data and you're
training it on like just a little piece of it on that extra data and this is one of the biggest problems we're
facing right now with these large language models is a lack of consistency and reliability in terms of
how they respond so the idea here is how do you make it take a set of instructions so that it is reliable
and consistent in its outputs and you're going to need to fine-tune the model that's what they do anyway
through reinforcement learning from Human feedback so this is why the synthetic data was mentioned
I'm sure is you need a lot of data to find- in these models like 10,000 50,000 100,000 different
conversations and you're not going to get that out of humans in any sort of cost effable or scalable way
valuation is another huge one there are very few reliable benchmarks right now in prompt engineering
and very few reliable ways to test your prompts in Mass I can tell you starting off as a prompt engineer
years and years ago at least that's how it feels like the most annoying part is testing the prompts
because there's always an edge case there's always like the second you think you got everything
worked out the client tries something and it doesn't work anymore and so really figuring out like what
are you testing this prompt against to make sure again again that it's reliable and then I think like the
the last one is the most important probably is there are these research papers coming out on prompt
engineering like every single day there are new techniques being discovered it is really like I think they
said earlier a very new field like obviously it existed before dropped but now with the capabilities of
these models it's like you can throw a stone and discover something new with prompt engineering it
feels like here I have to intersect because this exact last point I think every company should have that
type of person who is staying up to date with latest research and prompting and model orchestration I
would question it but just like sharing knowledge with the team not just like you save Tik Tok here or
there but actually reading research papers and applying that knowledge and then going and teaching it
the complexity just grows and I think that's definitely fascinating if you're interested in learning more
about AI or large language models br the sponsor of this video is really where you learn by doing with
thousands of interactive lessons in math data analytics programming and of course AI they have a
whole learning path on computer science and programming which has five different levels and 11
courses in it also one of their new immersive AI workshops is how large language models work if you're

you might be good fit if you but it doesn't sound to me like requirement no definitely not a requirement
but again this is going to be extremely competitive and not only that but then they also have that line
under which is strong candidates may also have you know what they're doing here is I think it's clever in
some ways which is that and I think I even say it later it's you should apply to this job even if you don't
think you're a fit because prompt engineering is such a new field we're all trying to figure it out and let's
be honest to be a prompt engineer you don't need to know how to code you need to know maybe some
of the concepts how things fit together the limitations that kind of stuff but you don't really know need to
know machine learning or how to code so it's obviously helpful as they've said in this job description but
it's good they didn't make that a requirement because you could be an amazing machine learning
engineer in fact we know a couple are terrible at profing or other side amazing prompt Engineers who
are learning programming right now not pointing fingers yes and it's funny because like I I use almost
Page 102
exclusively Claud to code things now again if you sat me down and we're like hey can you write some
code that makes it's say hello world i' like uh the things that I and you were able to do without
exclusively having software development or programming background just mind blowing if you're open
to experiment and learn that that part about it I really like accessibility to turn your ideas and avoid
these limitations which before would have just tapped you I programmed react with cl okay so strong
candidates computer science mathematics so all these things help as you said again this is a plus and
obviously it's going to be really competitive we are talking about half a million guys but it's really nice
that we are opening doors and to anybody with great ideas because you never know where this maybe
unique prompting technique or something that people build come from one more thing go there was a
really interesting thing in this application if you scroll down here it is while we encourage people to use
AI systems during their role don't use it for application process I actually really appreciated that setting
that expectation up front and having you agree obviously it's a little annoying but it's good that they put
that there and have it transparent that's what they want do you think people are not going to use aiop
oh 100% they're going use a no question we'll see like we both know it's impossible to actually check so
that they might do the thing where they look for those words that show up frequently or or whatever but
at the end of the day I'm sure they'll find someone very skilled in the art of prompt engineering for this
job
