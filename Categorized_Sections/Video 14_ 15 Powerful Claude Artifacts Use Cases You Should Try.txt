15 Powerful Claude Artifacts Use Cases You Should Try
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UA2W4xTqQzs
from all the different AI tools that I've tested for the last 6 months I think Claude artifact might be my
favorite and in this video I want to show you exactly how to use it I going to show you 15 really
interesting practical examples on how to use it and it just became available completely for free to
everyone starting today I think the best way to show you what cloud art effect is and what it could do is
showing you this example first then I'll show you actually how to activate it and then I'll show you 15
different examples as well that are very practical here is the App Store on my Mac I'm going to take a
screenshot of it just like this I'm going to go to claw. a and then I'm going to go ahead and upload this
add contents and I'm going to say create a web app using this image this is my only prompt then all I
have to do is choose a model so I'm going to use claw 3.5 Sonet right now that is a paid model but it is
extremely powerful but you could use the free ones and artifact still works I'm going to send this out and
this is what art effect is you see on the right side it's writing some code you don't have to even look at
the codee and then it's going to give you us a visual presentation of what this app actually looks like
and that was my very first attempt so here is the app right here and what you could do is you could
press publish right over here publish it it's going to create a link for you you're going to click this link it's
going to open up this website and this is what the app ends up looking like and you could share this link
with anyone and they could review it and this is just a web link this is not published on on the web so
you could share this link with anyone obviously I want to flush this out I want to add my own tools here
and then if someone wants to remix it meaning they could just take it from here and add to it they could
press remix artifact down here and it's going to go ahead and recreate that exact same app in their
cloud account and then they could have a follow-up revision here and add more to it or edit it the way
they want now Cloud artifact is available and it should be turned on already if it's not for some reason
and you don't see it doing what I just showed you when you ask it to create something if you press your
profile icon right here you could go to Future preview and it was showing up over here now it's part of
CLA so you don't have to turn it on but just in case it's not in yours go ahead and check this page and
this one is a new one too they usually roll out new options like this where you could turn them on and
off okay let me show you some examples let me just show you a few very basic ones and then we'll get
some more advanced dashboards and interactive apps and games and things like that this one right
here I just asked it to show me Claud artifact use cases and to create a diagram for me so this is the
diagram he created for me and he gave me all kinds of different things you could do so again it could
generate code and some of the more practical use cases that I use in day-to-day business is data
visualization so anytime I have to do a presentation now I just created a web app like this publish it
send that person a link and they have an interactive chart which I'm going to show you a bunch of
examples so it could do those things create flowart charts it could create mind maps it could also create
interactive components like an entire web app again from a screenshot or from a text prompt it could
create data dashboards is one of my favorite option interactive forms even learning lessons which I'm
going to show you too okay next on our list is interactive sales dashboard this is data visualization so
you could upload over here they have a little upload icon where you could give it different documents or
CSV files that have data or a PDF and it's going to pull in and create this interactive chart and all you
have to do is say turn this data into an interactive sales dashboard that was the prompt and it created it
here's our sales here's our profit and it's broken up month by month and then we could go ahead and
press publish again I'm just using sample data here but you could use it with your real information here
I just want to show you one quick functionality that might come in if you're building a more
comprehensive web app here but this could also sort data so if I press sort it's going to know that this
should be 1 through 7even and you can see it's moving seven over it's moving five it looks like we didn't
have six in this mix but it did visualize it in the right order it could also create visual charts for you so
these are really nice you could just download this as an image or share it inside of a different type of a
presentation you could create simple to-do list apps so this one I'm just going to add a to-do right here
you could go ahead and check this off right here you could go ahead and remove it again this took a
Page 78
simple prompt to create a simple to-do list app without any instructions I had previously made one that
was based on micros Microsoft to-do which is a to-do list app I use and it was pretty robust right here
and it took me about seven tries to get it to be exactly like Microsoft to do and function exactly like
Microsoft to do I have a different video that I made about this that shows you how to take a screenshot
and turn it into a web app like this and then go ahead and publish it here and share it with your team
now here's a little bit more advanced of a dashboard so this one I called business intelligence
dashboard and you could see it has sales performance it has market share if I refresh this page you
could see it has animations interactivity we have Financial forecast again expense and profit very
detailed month by month just imagine in a presentation you create something like this for your job
rather than just the same old boring PowerPoint presentations that people usually share in those things
and we have the breakdown again you could upload your own data so you could use your own data for
this and not just some madeup numbers and because we again designing this inside a Claude we're
not even looking at the code if you wanted to look at the code this is the code right here but it's always
going to take us to this artifacts preview and anything we don't like if we visually don't like something we
could go ahead and ask for a followup and it's going to go ahead and revise that for us and again just
press publish and share it and here's an interactive stock market dashboard very simple prompts by the
way I just said create an interactive stock market dashboard it created one it picked these stocks it
made up the numbers then with a follow-up prompt I could say now use this data to populate this
dashboard after I get it to look exactly like I want and it has a very simple layouts but again could be
very handy for a lot of different use cases now here's one this is called real-time social media sentiment
analyzer and it has different social medias that I've added here in this dropdown and this was again my
very first prompt and it's going to go ahead and take sample post from different social media tell you if
they're positive neutral or negative again I was trying to use this to see if more of my YouTube
comments are questions or they're just comments so I could try my best to reply to them and this could
analyze that for me this was my first attempt I usually make the dashboard get it to the way I want and
then in the second step when it's there I add some data to it that's actual data after I get the layout now
here's a couple of different things that could come in handy for education so I made a simple game
teaching people large language models interactive game here and it's just a true and false game so if
someone answers here this just three simple questions they will get and score again I could go ahead
and publish this share the link and then anybody could go ahead and take this test here's a much more
comprehensive version of it so this is a full-blown presentation and let me show you the presentation
first this is a very basic PowerPoint presentation straight out of chat GPT chat GPT could help you draft
a presentation and then just give you the Powerpoint file so all I did was after this power PowerPoint file
was finished which is something I'm doing in an actual presentation that I flushed out with my own
information and with the help of chat GPT I haven't formatted it because I wanted to turn it into an
interactive chart inside a clot so I saved it as a PDF I just pressed this little upload icon I uploaded it and
I said turn this into an interactive lesson that was my only prompt now here's what it looks like so people
could go through this interactive lesson go to the next lesson like this and you could see it's adding to
the percentage as it's getting closer to 100% they could also take this quiz here which is really nice
each little lesson has a quiz that goes along with it now for an educator like me this is just a fantastic
tool so I could see more teachers using it I haven't looked at a single line of code to create all these
things inside of the cloud website right now now here's another cool thing you could create a competitor
dashboard so all I did was I went on this website view stat this is something Mr Beast has made I took a
screenshot let's say I want to to show someone the top 10 YouTube channels and compare them right I
could do this in my specific category of AI and Tech and things like that I uploaded that dashboard this
is what we got let me go ahead and publish it and here is that dashboard again very interactive is
showing subscribers and Views and you have this channel ranking you could also sort them right here
which is really nice and he did that again with like a prompt or two and each prompt was just a sentence
and a revision to just improve the formatting here now here's a little fun game of snake I made so it
works fine let me just crash into the wall here let's go this way okay exactly how a game of snake could
work and again this was make a game of snake I didn't say react this is what the language the coding
language that he decided to choose but we don't have to worry about that again this is just for anybody
that could just turn a simple text prompt into a working interactive app now if you're not too familiar with

Claude they also have something else called Claude projects and when you combine projects and
artifact you get something very powerful this is part of their paid plan with projects what you could do is
give it its own knowledge base it could actually take ton of different PDFs for example from your
company's information or your personal information and it also has its own set of instructions that you
could give it so I did create a different video about exactly how projects work very powerful option and
with artifacts if you have any practical use cases that you're trying to R let me know in the comment
section so I could use that as an example for an upcoming video thanks so much for watching I'll see
you next time
