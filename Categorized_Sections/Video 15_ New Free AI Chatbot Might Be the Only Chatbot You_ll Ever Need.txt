New Free AI Chatbot Might Be the Only Chatbot You'll Ever Need

I just came across a brand new AI chatbot and this one could do something I've never seen any other
chatbot do and I'm not affiliated this is not a sponsored video but I think you're going to find this really
useful here this chatbot is called not Diamond you could use it at chat. diamond. and as I'm recording
this is completely free to use it has no limitations I'm sure they're going to add it at some point but let
me show you exactly what it does so this has access to all the top AI models in one place and there are
other apps that do this too that's not the unique part of it so you're going to make sure all these are
checked on they are by default so you're going to get access to all the cloud models you're going to get
access to all the GPT models llama models even perplexity is included here so then what I do is I would
just use it just like any other chat bot I'm going to type in my prompt I'm going to try this prompt can you
draft a reply for this email keep it friendly and Casual I'm going to paste this email here and I'm going to
go ahead and send this out and this is the unique part of this ch mbot so it's going to give you a
response but if you look on the bottom here it picked claw 3.5 Sonet here and he made that decision on
its own and the reason why he did that is because it thinks for the specific task of replying to an email
claw 3.5 Sonet is the best model which I agree with so depending on your prompt it's going to choose in
the background the best model available to answer you and again all of it is available here so all the
best models it has access to now my workflow right now is jumping between different chat Bots yours
might be the same right so some things related to writing a lot of times I use clot sometimes when it
comes to summarizing existing texts I like chat GPT more let's try another one what's in the news today
so this one a lot of the models are not going to have internet access to be able to answer that and if you
look on the bottom it CHS perplexity again if I was doing that search myself I would probably open up a
new web page go to perplexity run that prompt right I'm not going to probably use chat GPT or Claud
for that now let me go to a website I'm just going to copy this entire website I'm going to ask for a short
summary here paste everything in that blog post send that out and again this time it chose claw 3.5
Sonet so sometimes I personally use chat GPT to do this task but it looks like this is the model he
chose and if you disagree with his choice well you just click right here and it has all these other models
you could choose from so if I wanted to use chat GPT I'm gonna get the answer here out of GPT 40
right so I could just switch between them and one more really cool thing I found is if you give it a
thumbs up every time let's say that's my preference that for summaries I always want to use GPT 40 if I
give it a thumbs up this is going to remember that every time I ask for a summary to use this model
moving forward and not use cloud if I give it a thumbs down it's going to try a different model one more
really interesting thing it has under the settings he has Arena mode so if you turn this on I'm going to
give it another prompt here I'm going to ask it for marketing methods for small businesses this is the
battle mode where you're going to get one on the right side one on the left side and if I go to the bottom
of it you're not going to know which model it is so you're going to need to give it a score here which one
is good which one is bad so I'm going to choose this one here on the right and then when I choose it it's
going to tell me which model won between these two models so this was claw 3 hi cou versus GPT 40
now if you also look on the bottom it's going to show you speed and it's also going to show you a cost
as I mentioned right now this is totally free there's no way to even pay for it and I'm really not sure how
they're doing that but the cost is if you're a developer I believe they offer an API for developers here so
it's showing you the cost so you could understand how these models compare in cost and let me see if
it's any good at analyzing documents because you can upload documents to it I'm going to say give me
a short summary and Yep this was related to my last video related to Claude artifact it spelled Claude
wrong because my transcription also had that spelled incorrectly but now it knows to use gp4 every
time I ask for a summary which is my personal preference and this is also very useful right here it has
something called custom system prompts if you turn this on it lets you give it a system prompt and what
a system prompt lets you do is it lets you give a set of instructions at the account level so you don't
have to do that inside of every individual prompt so I've built something it's a custom GPT that's
available for free inside of chat GPT and this one creates the custom instructions for you so all you
Page 81
have to do is type in something very simple and mine is just going to be always reply in a casual and
friendly tone like you're talking to a friend and if I send this out this generates something much more in-
depth as far as a custom instruction goes so you an AI model designed to respond in casual tone like
your ch with a friend it should be warm approachable engaging so I could just copy this over and then
go back to this app and then type that out and this is my casual tone and I'm going to go ahead and
save that as my system prompt and now all I have to do is pick this casual tone I could make multiple
different system prompts here and then it's going to take care of it in the background for us every time
we start a new chat it knows to use that prompt in the background and you don't have to include it in
every single prompt now now if you're like me and you're using a bunch of different AI chat Bots I'm
going to perplexity for research I'm going to chat GPT for summaries I'm going to Claud for writing
emails and things like that well this just took care of all of that for us in the same chat right and it has
access to all the top models it's not even excluding Geminis there llama is there so it's really strange
that this is free right now so I wouldn't cancel any of my subscriptions just yet but really interesting tool
that does something that other chat Bots just can't do because they're just made by that one specific
company typically and they're not going to be able to make that selection in the background for us there
are other platforms where you could choose between chat Poots but you have to manually choose that
this has been making really good decisions in the background in a couple hours I mean testing again
I'm not canceling anything but give it a try let me know what you think in the comment section and I'll
catch you on the next video
