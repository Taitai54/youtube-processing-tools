building an AI automation agency in 2024 has never been easier and in today's video I'm going to be
walking you through some of the best case studies that I've potentially ever seen of big businesses
using Ai and how it's helped them now what I want you to do is take every single case study that I'm
about to go through and zoom out see how this can affect other businesses see how you can
implement this into a smaller business for example or see how you could do something similar but
mostly I want you to start seeing the patterns in how these different automations and different AI
Solutions are helping these businesses so that you can start doing the same with your client if you're
still sat there thinking that the AI automation agency model isn't the one for you then stick around watch
till the end of this video I guarantee you it will change your mind so let's jump into it so look the case
studies that I want to go through today have actually been released by Salesforce now there's over 83
different case studies and each one gives us a little insight into the types of clients that they're working
with and how AI is helping them okay so one thing we have to realize is Salesforce they have their own
range of products they have lots of different tools crms AI Solutions everything built in house and these
case studies we're about to go over specifically go over clients that are using the whole family of
souforce whether they're using slack whether they're using Einstein which is their AI whether they're
using Sal Force as a CRM or their analytics dashboard whatever it is Sal Force covers everything and a
lot of these clients use the whole Suite so look before I jump into the article I want to go over a few
things with you what I really think that you can take from this video and from these case studies that I'm
about to go through with you is what it should do is give you a really clear idea of what is being done in
the real world and what is being done at a higher level at the end of the day you can go and create chat
Bots and you can go and create simple automations for people but you're you're going to hit a wall
you're never going to be there to scout to those big numbers if that is all you're doing and I don't care
what anyone says if you go and start an agency and you manage to get it to 50K per month selling just
chat bot then please come and let me know because you are a hero my friend what we can do with the
information that s Source has given us is we can start to look at the trends and the key words that
different clients are using to show us what their initial pain points were and if you're smart you can start
to reverse engineer from these case studies and see how you can potentially roll that into another
industry or a smaller client that is potentially Within Reach of your agency so let's take a look at this this
is EVP at Vonage he says sales forces Solutions have helped us to automate workflows to allow our
teams to collaborate more easily drive value for customer customers and fuel our International
expansion so let's dive into this their website is littered with all of this information and what we can take
from this is well we know that Vonage was struggling with automated workflows and Salesforce has
stepped in seen a huge opportunity there and a massive paino that Vonage was likely facing and
they've been able to help them fix that so as I mentioned Salesforce have their own generative AI tool
um or solution it's called Einstein now Einstein 1 is a platform that unifies your data AI CRM
development and Security in a single comprehensive platform it empowers it admins and developers
with an extensible AI platform facilitating fast development of generative apps and automation so in
essence I would assume it's something similar to zapia and make tied into a platform like relevance
where you can set up automations and you can create generative conversational flows all of that stuff
now this is he Conan director of brand EXP in platforms at General Mills the combination of AI data and
CRM allows us to help busy parents solve the what is for dinner D dilemma with with personalized
recipe recommendations their family will love so again we're seeing something that we've spoken about
on this channel before by creating personalized uh experiences whether that be from a personal trainer
in a gym creating guides on how to work out or creating meal plans or in the case of General Mills
helping busy parents find out what is for dinner now of course this is done on a much bigger scale these
guys are tying it into their CRM data they're looking at what products people are buying and what their
clients are buying and then they're coming up with recipes and solutions off of the back of that data now
nine times out of 10 we're not going to have these huge crms with these huge amounts of data inside
Page 62
but it does make you start thinking about what can we do with data that we are collecting and if the data
is in a CRM how can we use that to supercharge that business and whatever they're trying to do so
look let's jump into some of these case studies I know you are desperate to see them number one we
have Gucci now I've boiled each case study down to the core of what is actually being fixed here with
AI and in Gucci's case just improved their customer experience now Gucci's 600 client advisors across
seven Global hubs can now communicate with a clear brand voice while amplifying the human touch
with AI Gucci's nine teams are empowered to engage with customers on their specific interests along
Ong the customer Journey now if I flick over to the website and I'll link this website down below so you
can check out all the other case studies we can see here that what they've essentially done is they've
essentially built a Gucci conversational bot that is trained on all of Gucci's product catalog it can be
used on WhatsApp it can be used in the store but it's essentially a bot or an agent that is trained on
everything Gucci it speaks like Gucci it helps their clients it helps their customers and it just gives
Gucci's team another angle another Edge right so I definitely recommend flicking through this and
seeing exactly how it works and what they've done but again they've tied into Gucci's CRM on inside of
Salesforce and they have now supercharged advisors and Gucci's team members because they have
all that data at their fingertips that is now plugged into a generative AI model that is actually sending
messages on Whatsapp or responding to people on the website once they've logged in so really simple
if you think about it like that and the reason why I wanted to break it down into what it is they're actually
trying to do and in this case is just customer experience I want you to start looking at these case studies
trying to find the core thing that they trying to help because once you do that you start to realize that
actually that is the pain point that a lot of people are facing we know that there's tons of Ecom stores or
retail stores just like Gucci that could definitely utilize something similar or benefit from a similar piece
of tech just like Gucci's done if they took their product catalog and they took all their orders maybe
that's done inside of a Shopify store they looked at what is being ordered and they looked at how
frequently people are buying certain things you can start to use that data to supercharge your client's
business think about it why wouldn't gym shark be using this why wouldn't represent be using this why
isn't every single Ecom store out there using some form of generative AI that is tied into the back end of
whatever system they're using or CRM and it's given personalized customiz support to that customer so
let's jump on to the next one the next one is make a wish now again I've boiled this down to alterations
something stood out in the make a wish case study for me which was super interesting so make a wish
previously sent thank you messages to donors manually after they made a gift now the organization
automatically sends personalized thank you messages after every contribution so if we jump onto the
make a wish case study and for those of you who don't know make a wish is this like charity that helps
terminally ill kids essentially make their dreams come true you know you see it all the time like super
Heroes going into hospitals and that kind of thing and and it's fueled by donations as we just saw they
were originally sending manual thank you messages out so that was taking up a huge amount of time
and super labor intensive so why wasn't there some form of Automation in place that handled that so
we can see here what the difference looks like we can see that staff can now enter all their information
through the portal built on experience Cloud again another souforce product this allows team members
to track how many children want to visit a specific location and helps coordinate their visits more
efficiently now again we can take information from that right now there's probably plumbers and
electricians out there that have tens of jobs every single day and they don't really know how to prioritize
what job to do if they get stuck in traffic somewhere they may have to call the last person up and cancel
that person what if there was a system in place that they could Implement where the AI essentially
looked at Google Maps or it looked at the roots that this electrician had to take that day and it actually
started to plan their day around the current jobs that they had and the type of work that was involved so
again we're not specifically looking at Salesforce products here we're not looking at using Salesforce
products what we're looking at is the use cases and seeing how we can incorporate them into the types
of clients that we're going after so the one that stood out for me is like I said they were sending manual
thank you messages and that is all now handled automatically um through another Salesforce product
but again we can do this inside of our own crms we can set up workflows we can set up zap your
actions whatever it may be we can do this ourselves another great case study of how a huge company
is using simple automations inside of their business and to me I was blown away because I was like
Page 63
well why the hell were they doing it manually before it made no sense but they were so that should give
you hope knowing that there is so many businesses out there that need your help now the next case
study is rosignol which is a big ski brand and again I've taken what their main outcome was with
working with Salesforce and for them it's c analysis now you could say customer analysis is kind of
across everyone because that is what Salesforce does they tie everything into their CRM but especially
with the Ross ull case study Ross 's marketing team generates three times more campaigns per week
thanks to automated Journeys and AI now it dynamically translate campaign content into different
languages and sends emails at times when they are most likely to be read so again going back to the
analysis side of things rossal is essentially just looking looking at their orders and the types of products
that they're selling to through their B2B wholesale Network and they're making decisions based on that
data they're analyzing that data and they're using AI to analyze that data which is then supercharging
their decision- making so again we can look at this and we can say what other companies could benefit
from this and there are honestly an endless amount of businesses that could use something like this
wherever there is data if you can analyze it in a smarter way and help that business owner make make
a smarter decision that would ultimately lead to a higher Roi or reduce cost in staff hours or increase
efficiencies then you are onto a winner so overall rosing achieved a 300% increase in volume of weekly
marketing campaigns two times contribution of CRM to e-commerce Revenue which is crazy and a
28% growth for group in 2022 to 2023 which is just insane now I'm also not saying go and steal all of
this information but don't be afraid to use these in conversation or talk about these to prospected leads
that you're speaking to because at the end of the day these are real case studies of how AI has help
these businesses now this next one is a big one this is Spotify I'm sure we all use Spotify and what
stood out for me was their client onboarding and kind of user Journey when it comes to running ads for
different businesses so let's jump into this now Spotify advertising has increased the number of
marketing campaigns it runs each year fivefold simply by automating customer Journeys like
registration so the Spotify 1's pretty interesting cuz they've done a lot of different stuff and it kind of ties
all of the case studies we just spoken about together so for Spotify they've done a lot with
personalization so inside of their advertising their tracking website visits with personalization visitors
see customized buttons and Banners based on their previous activity we're looking at an increased
efficiency in workflows just by centralizing the workforce inside of slack and helping them get on
boarded with different workflows that exist inside of slack they've got opportunities scoring helping rep
sell fast with AI by prioritizing leads based on those most likely to close and again think about that you
can use that for anyone in the B2B space that is trying to qualify leads or looking through a CRM at
leads that have filled in a bunch of details and then you can get some form of AI agent to qualify those
leads based on the information they filled out that is another huge huge benefit there opportunity
scoring so definitely take note of that and again we just get another insight into a huge business just like
Spotify in how automations and AI have helped them so look are you going to land Spotify tomorrow as
a client definitely not but what this should do is it should give you insights into how the biggest brands
on Earth are using AI in some way and if we really simplify everything all we're looking for is an
indication of pain and then we're trying to find ways of how automations or AI Solutions can alleviate
that pain that is how we're going to be able to charge money and that is how we're going to start to
scale our AI automation agency okay now it's now up to you to go and check these case studies out for
yourself like I said there's 83 so there are nuggets of gold in every single one of these case studies and
each one should give you more confidence in terms of understanding what types of businesses need
what and what types of businesses have different pain points now I wanted to leave you with a really
quick idea on how you can actually you know discover these pain points and find these golden nuggets
and this was just taken from the Gucci page all we really looking for is words sentences and phrases
like this now ai generates b-size conversation repliers in a Gucci fied brand voice to help advisers
assist customers in store by phone or via WhatsApp and it's all done with connected customer data AI
also helps the fashion house practice its Mantra the human touch powered by technology by scaling the
capabilities of its advisers with brand ready messages this is all keywords and messaging that we want
to be using on our site these are all phrases and ways of packaging up what we're actually offering to
make it make sense to these Brands and these companies these are all rocket fuel for our agency and
if you go through all of these different case studies I guarantee you you're going to walk away with
