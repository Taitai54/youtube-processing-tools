URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFTK7tEe4O8
about grock and grock 2 which is the brand new release this literally just got announced a few hours
ago you can see grock 2 mini beta right there is ready to go and we're going to be talking through
because this is pretty urgent to share with you basically there's a new player in town grock 2 turning the
SEO game on its head I'm going to show you what it does differently to GPT we're going to be
comparing it directly against GPT and Claude and that's just the tip of the iceb because today as well
we're going to be talking about how to create SEO optimized content the ranks We're going to be
talking about the fun mode trick that unlocks Rock's full potential and my grock is leaving chat GPT and
CLA behind in some ways I'll be talking about that in a minute and we'll get straight into this bad boy
now this is live so if you have any questions feel free to ask him as we go along otherwise I'm going to
kick this bad boy off now if you're not sure what Gro is this is the AI model directly inside Twitter so it's
launched by Elon Musk Elon Musk owns X he's launched his new AI model inside there called grock
and this is the brand new version of it called Gro 2 now what's interesting about this is that this is
actually available for free and I'll show you how to do it in a minute plus it can now generate images
which I'll come on to in a minute and we'll be covering all the latest use cases for that gal says I'm
starting to think Julian actually an AI there's no way this man has still has value to deliver thank you
very much sir and what we're going to do now is I'll just be looking through and showing you some of
the crazy stuff that people have created using grock plus how you can do similar things so if we actually
look at the announcement you can see that grock actually just announced this and it wasn't it wasn't
released so long ago so it was literally just announced a few hours ago yesterday and additionally I'm
going to show you some examples of what Gro 2 looks like so if we type in grock 2 into the explore bar
here it's trending like crazy right now and you can see some of the crazy stuff you can do with this now
if you actually look at Gro it can actually generate memes and it can generate memes with famous
people's faces as you can see right here and if we keep scrolling down for example you got Donald
Trump sprinting in the Olympics Sprint to Trump as you can see right here if we go back some other
stuff let's have a look why is that not loaded properly here's another one so you can see how it
generates like cartoons you got Kim Jung over there as well so it generates famous people's faces
which I've never seen before and it seems to have way less guard rails and way less restrictions versus
anything in chat gbt and Claude here's another example so you can see for example you've got some
interesting images here with Trump loads of people creating Trump memes at the minute and yeah it's
it's crazy stuff in fact if you look at the actual thumbnail that we've generated for this video which you
can see right here this thumbnail was generated with AI in one single click how did I do it using grock
now one of the first places that we're going to start is I'm going to walk you through exactly how these
modes work you can switch between beta and fun mode and non- fun mode right so this is the smaller
version of Gro it's not like the full version full capability this is just a mini version because it's in beta
mode right now and you can switch between fun mode or non- fun mode obviously you can guess what
the differences between of them one one is more fun than the other and first of all how we're going to
kick this off is we're going to use a prom that I usually use for create content and then we're going to
plug that directly into grock so let me do that for a minute and you can see I pasted in this S&P; right
here if you want to get access check out SEO systems in my free course and then go to Gro 2 and
you'll find it right there and acram says Gro with a K not a q absolutely it's not to be confused with llama
3.1 or anything that this is Gro with a K as you can see there so we're going to hit enter on this article
and we'll see what it's like for generating content and how good it actually is now as we're waiting for
that to run let's answer some of the other questions we've got Jason says hey good to see you on here
mate and tourist spot 10 says please give me a prompt for optimizing article I think I gave you one last
time mate but we're going to use the same prompt which is this one right here if you want the sap it's in
the free course SEO systems and then Twitter what else we got Yash says nice nice to see you on here
nram says what's the language model on this bad boy maybe we can check the languages in a second
actually so you can see this is the content that's created now what I'm actually going to do is I will pull
Page 22
this up and I think to be a fair test bear in mind grock 2 is a mini version the only fair way to test it will be
to test it versus chat gbt 40 because that is a mini version of Gro right that's a mini version of chat gbt
so we're going to switch to GPT 40 and then we'll plug exactly the same prompt that we used inside
Gro and compare what the content creation is like versus each two now I have a feeling which one's
going to be best I'll tell you afterwards but I would honestly say that there's a lot more two gr that most
people don't realize and I'll show you some more use cases for that in a minute what else we got here
so go says thoughts on H using AG domains from what I've tested is I've run one test so I don't have
like a statistically relevant test from what I've seen it's not working that well for me compared to new
domains right so for example if you look at the new domain that we built out recently which we did after
my public case study got wiped out you can see Julian gold. codk and you can see the traffic is going to
the Moon right right and that was just in a couple of months that is a brand new domain had no history
we just built some quality back on it put some quality content on it and it's a living the dream right gets
more drafted than most websites I would say for me that is personally working better than age domains
when I've tested both now I haven't got a statistically relevant case study for that so I'm not going to say
this is the best option but that's just what's working for me so we're going to keep going through now
and if we compare these side by side as you can see right here if we look at the content what I would
say is if we for example look at the title and we'll compare chat GPT 40's title right here we'll compare
that versus Twitter you can see the the title from chat gp40 is better quality and then if we scroll down
you can see that the content itself is more interesting right so let me zoom in and I'll show you what I
mean this content is certainly more interesting than the content written inside Gro if you ask me and
then if we scroll down as well with the same prompt with the same keyword Etc if we compare these
side by side you can see that grock isn't that good for creating SEO content simply because it doesn't
give as much information and it's all about these bullet points you can see it's almost like a just a little
reference list with with different bullet points now what you can also do is if you select some content you
can click on ask Rock right there and then it will elaborate on the content that it's created right but
honestly I just don't think it's that great for creating articles yet maybe that will change with the new
model but yeah so far I'm seeing the chat gbt 40 which is free bear in mind Gro is paid unless you use a
method that I'll show you in a second and so yeah I would say GPT 40 is still better when it comes to
creating content I'm not even going to compare it to Claude because Claude of course is ridiculously
powerful and it's not a mini model so I think it'd be unfair to compare those side by side what you can
see here is what it looks like the content Etc now I'm going to run through some more use cases in a
second including YouTube thumbnails and picture generation right now this is really powerful because
for example if we go into Google and we'll type something like perplexity AO into Google not only can I
rank on the first page of Google but I can also rank with my images so if you go to images right here
you can see that my image which is a YouTube thumbnail is ranking number one for that keyword as
well which is just another way of generating more traffic to that video same with this image right here
and if we keep scrolling down same with this image and this one too right so you can rank with AI
generated images you can host them on different platforms this is hosted on LinkedIn for example this
one was hosted on YouTube you could host on your website wherever you want to host it but the main
thing is that you can generate images with AI and then rank those directly on Google too so let me
show you another example of how you can use Gro to do this so let's say for example I want to rank for
the keyword grock SEO what I could do is if we go through some of my chat history right here and we'll
look at some of the previous chats let me go back we'll go into previous chats and we'll scroll down and
we'll click on a random example let me find one for you quickly here we won't be looking for casb seo
let me have a look it's not even showing me the latest history right here all right let me show you an
example of how to generate this we'll put Gro Elon Musk with a crazy AI robot that looks menacing right
something like that and the thing that I've noticed when it comes to generating images with Gro and I've
only tested this for a few hours but there more specific you can be with the prompt and the more basic
and simple it is the better that's going to turn out right so for example you can see this image generated
right here we could put the text on the left right here but that is an image that you could rank for Gro AI
SEO which you'll see with this YouTube video when it ranks on Google as well so that's one of the best
ways that I think you can rank with gr a Ico is that you generate images and then you rank those on
Google because the image quality is so much better than chat GPT let me pull up another example so if
Page 23
we take exactly the same prompt and we go on to chat GPT 40 mini just to compare them side by side
we'll hit in the same prompt right here and whilst we're waiting for that to load just one thing if you want
to get a free SEO strategy session link is in the comments in the description and we can oneto one give
you tips on how to grow your business how to get more Le traffic and sales of SEO and how to rank on
Google based on what's working for me I've already shown you proof of that working right now so as an
example if we compare the exact same prompt from grock which got us a fairly decent output I would
say I'd probably still try and create some more interesting images but that's not bad for a first go if we
compare that versus chat GPT you can see that chat GPT refuses my orders it's not listening to me it
doesn't want to hear it right so for example I've put Elon mus with a crazy AI robot that looks menacing
and it said I couldn't generate the image because the request didn't align with the content policy and if
you want to adjust a description or create a new idea feel free to share it essentially go do one mate I
don't care how much you pay me right and so Gro is performing better than chat GPT simply because
it's less restricted and I find the same problem with for example Claude when I'm using Claude as well I
have exactly the same problem where quite often dayto day I'll be restricted with what I can generate
even if it's just a basic task and it's not even anything to do with PC stuff so it's to see that actually if you
take the guard rails off an AI model it can be a lot more useful now obviously if that gets in the wrong
hands good but yeah you get the image Neil says hi Julian shout out to you sir good to see you on here
I'm we going to keep going through this now and if you do have any questions about this as we go
along feel free to post it so we've covered so far fun mode versus normal we've covered creating and
ranking articles using Gro Ai and how chat GPT is actually better for Content creation we've covered
YouTube thumbnails and also how to rank images right so you can rank images you can create images
like this you can actually ask it like can I use this on my website and for YouTube thumbnails let's ask it
that we'll hit enter and it said you're welcome to use the image for your website or thumbnails but
remember I'm just a text Bas AI right and so it can actually it actually gives you to use these images as
you can see right here so the other thing that I would say and this is probably the most powerful thing
about Twitter in general is that you can actually post articles directly inside Twitter and when you do this
let me show you an example so when you do this it will appear on your article section on Twitter like
here and you can see that some of these articles get a decent amount of views so for example if you
published an article on your blog today it might take seven or two weeks so might take a month before
you start getting any decent amount of views you can see already just by posting this article right here
we got 400 views on this article you can see again we got 600 views on this article you can see with
this article we got 88115 views right and so if you're posting content let's say you're creating it with Gro
using the prompts I showed previously then creating it inside Twitter you can actually get a decent
amount of views and sometimes more than your actual website as an example of that if we type in the
keyword let's see AIC strategies into to Google like you can see right here we'll see what's ranking you
can see that my Twitter article is ranking on Google right here and this was created four days ago but
it's already got 800 views and so if you want to get a lot of traffic to your website quickly not only can
you publish and rank that content with SEO but you can also post that article inside Twitter and get
more views that way which means the same amount of work but you get bigger and better results like
I'm showing you so that's one of the most powerful ways to use grow as well Doctor Who design says
hello hello to you too and we've talked about ranking articles with Twitter directly the other cool thing
that I want to show you right is that you can actually animate these images so let me go back to Grog
let me find it here like you can see and then we'll go back to that chat that we just created this one right
here as you can see and you can actually animate these images using Luma dreamlabs which is
another fre tool for AI so if we go on to Luma Labs as you can see here's a couple of examples I
created earlier so if we check out this particular thumbnail what I did was I downloaded the image from
grock generated it inside grock and then uploaded it to Luma images and you can see it looks pretty
cool if you ask me right and so you can animate and turn the memes or the gifs or the images that you
create on grock and turn them into animated gifs like this and then they're basically AI videos but it's
completely faceless pretty crazy stuff if you ask me so we've also talked about that the other thing that I
want to show you with grock is that you can actually generate content around the latest events so let's
go back to Gro and I'll show you what I mean we'll start a new chat you can click new chat in the top
right and if we click on tell me today's headlines what this is going to do is it will actually generate the
Page 24
latest news and the headlines from today now why is that why does Gro have the latest information
versus other platforms it's because grock has all this data coming in from people tweeting and talking
about certain events that are happening and so it can use that data in real time to generate responses
now it's not always 100% right and it doesn't always get the facts right as you can imagine with any sort
of AI model but if you ask for example chat GPT or you ask Claude which are two direct competitors
when was your last update and we'll plug the same question into Claude you can see that the last
actually that's strange I've never seen that before but it says the last update for chat GPT was August
2024 but yeah there we go so the knowledge base was updated to April 20124 inside Claude so even
though Claude is really good for creating content it's not updated with the latest information whereas
Gro it actually is updated with the latest automation now Harissa says Julian good job job as always
happy to help thank you and glad it helps and you can see here for example is come up with a bunch of
headlines for example as you can see in this headline it says political Shenanigans so these are the
headlines from today and it says there's a buzz about Trump targeting Google and Cala Harris
suggesting some sort of media manipulation it's like watching a Space Opera where the villain accuses
a Galaxy's News Network bias right so if we go on to Google and we'll just check that headline is
actually true and relevant we're going to type in for example Trump Google and Harris and see if that
actually is a headline and as you can see right here there is a headline from today from six hours ago
which is brand new news and it's been covered directly inside Gro so it's quite interesting to see if you
were in a certain Niche where you're trying to create content on the latest news and topics I think this
could be one of the best ways to do it because otherwise what you'd have to do is get the latest news
from somewhere else and then upload that to Claude for Content creation now I've got a couple of
questions let's see what we got here go says would you use Gro for blog images versus other
Alternatives not sure how you go about images to use usually for blog posts yeah so I don't actually
insert a lot of blogs a lot of images into my blogs but I'll show you an example of what this looks like in
action so if we go to malet's post on LinkedIn and we'll look at some relevant articles I've created like for
example this one what I usually do is I generate the image with AI and I use that as a banner image for
the content like you can see right here now the thing to note here is if you look at it the image itself isn't
as realistic as Gro so grock's images are way more realistic for example if I put lazy chat GPT AI robot
surrounded by cache we'll put that image prompt into grock and we'll see what it comes back with
versus chat GPT but like you can see right here the content from Gro is quite often sorry the content
from chat GPT is quite often unrealistic right it's more like cartoon style whereas if you look at the image
from grock it's more kind of like a shutter stock image or a stock image right and so I would say that if
you want more realistic images go with Gro but if you want more images that are kind of like cartoon
style then go with chat GPT that's my take movers says grock access is like $8 a month right I'm going
to show you two ways you can I'm going to show you one way to access this for free actually and you
can get access in the chatbot Arena right so if you go to LM arena. and I've included all the links I'm
talking about inside the SCP and I've shown you how to get that today but you can actually get access
to to sus column r that is a model inside the LM Arena that is actually grock to beta version and so you
can use it for free inside here and so if you just want to get free access instantly just go to LM arena.
aod equals Susy column up just like that URL right there so normally Gro directly inside Twitter is $8 a
month for premium but you can get free access using this right here Neil says when I book a call of your
company for a strategy session could we also discuss these kind of strategies because some people
say SEO is dead I say SEO is dead all the time so yeah that's it if you book in a call with us link is in the
comments and description or just go to julian. co.uk you can book in a call with us and we'll talk you
through exactly how we're using AI to rank and some of our best strategy now one of the best ways you
can learn how to do this is directly inside the SEO Elite circle inside the SEO Elite Circle we have a
bunch of different courses on how you can rank with AI plus some of the newest systems I cannot show
you on YouTube directly so if you want some of the most powerful ways to make money and rank with
SEO and AI join the SEO Elite Circle and as a client you also get access to that too dword says I signed
up with you how do I log in for the Mastery if you want to log in for SEO Mastery I mean I it sounds like
you've logged in I it sounds like you've you've bought the link building Mastery course if that's the case
um then you can just log in you'll see the email directly if you cannot find the email or login details just
message us at me Julian gold.com send us the email address that you've bought with and we will give

you instant access GC says thank you for all the videos so far may I ask you if you are planning to do
any videos in programmatic SEO what's your thoughts on that my thoughts are that I have to be very
careful what I show directly on YouTube because so many public case studies get slapped and so what
I've actually done is you will find multiple programmatic SEO coaching sessions inside the SEO Elite
Circle just go to the guest coaching sessions because I can't show that stuff on YouTube right no way I
can show that on YouTube and mover says dope thanks for the GRE grop tip happy to help and Al
Farah says Dar sucks so much just use something else mid Journey ideogram or flux so flux is actually
the model inside Gro from what I remember I'm just going to double check that but I'm pretty sure the
flux is a model let me double check we'll put flux grock inside Twitter and yeah you can see the grop 2
when it dropped they snuck in the flocks model inside the image generation so that's what they're using
to generate images inside this model is flux and it's pretty cool the fact that it's not guard railed pretty
crazy stuff if you ask me the other thing that I would say is that if you're in a gray Niche let's say you're
in some sort of gray Niche where normally you couldn't create content for your Niche with AI because
there's guard rails on chat GPT or there's guard rails on Claude potentially I would imagine you could
use something like Gro because it has less guard rails on what you can create on there as you can see
right here like Mickey Mouse giving us a finger and smoking a cheeky little cigarette right there that's an
example of how little this is guard real so it's crazy stuff to be honest with you let's keep going through
now and I've talked about fun mode versus normal creating and ranking articles YouTube thumbnails
I've talked about ranking images how to rank articles inside Twitter I've talked about Luma labs and
also the latest news and recent updates inside gr that you can use for Content creation and we've also
compared Claude versus chat GPT for outputs plus how you can use this for gry nich Content along
with something else that's quite interesting so what you can do let me show you an example right here
you can grab the URL of a tweet then you can go down to Gro and if you paste this URL into Gro as
you can see so if you paste the URL from the post it will actually explain what the actual content is
about right and as you can see it explains okay this is by that account blah blah blah it giv some
examples of post from that person and it just gives a little breakdown on the post which is quite
interesting as well now the other thing you can do is if you select some of the texts you can ask Rock
and then it will expand on some of the other stuff it said so there's like 10 different ways you can use
this and the thing that interests me is not how powerful Gro is right now but how powerful Gro will be on
later updates because if it's using the data from Twitter and it's all fed in in real time then it's only going
to become smarter and better and also you can see they're upgrading it in different ways now with Elon
talking a lot about the freedom of speech that ties into the freedom of using AI right because for
example you can see there's less guard rails you can see it's less restricted inside these AI models
which means that if you can use this in ways that you're not restricted potentially that's going to appeal
to a lot more people and people don't people are always looking for like ways to jailbreak AI anyway so
this is one of the most powerful ways to just get this sort of content good Vib says you've been amazing
in the last videos amazing value crazy you've got a new fan thanks so much really appreciate that and
Good Vibes to you so thank you sir floor says this is great happy to help and master techno says okay
well that's what I'm talking about all right so I want to run you through a few other notes that I've got
right here including let me pull this up I want to I want to show you you how well this is performed so far
right so you got to bear in mind that grock is a mini model right so it's not the most powerful model it's a
smaller version and it's in beta so it's more like GPT 40 so I would keep your expectations low for now
but when the full version comes out then it's going to be better the other thing that I've seen and some
people have talked about this is that there's a limit now I've not seen a limit on this right so you can see
for example some people saying there's a limit on how much you can create probably about 25 an hour
when it comes to content on grock I've not seen that I've not seen any limits but that's an interesting
thing to note also as you can see right here grock 2 image generation is better than llamas and has no
dump guard rails which you can see right there and if you're wondering about the pricing of Gro like I
said you can access it for free I've already shown you how to do that but also you can get access via
premium which is $8 a month on Twitter so for example premium starts at $8 a month or $84 per year
on the web the other thing that I want to show you is my Twitter sap for actually ranking and creating
content because if you're thinking about using Twitter for SEO then you can use some of the workflows
I've created that have proven to rank for me as you can see right here and then you can also Syndicate
Page 26
it into different posts right so you can take your SEO content you can Rank and create content directly
Insite Twitter you can publish it and then you can Syndicate that content in multiple ways I've got two
different automations right there the 100x content machine and the make.com automation this is all in
the video notes as I've shown you how to get access you can get access inside the free course just go
to SEO systems and then Gro 2 you'll find it and that's basically a way that you can rank with Twitter
SEO now if you're wondering okay does Twitter actually Rank and that sort of thing I've already
showing you an example but if we go into x.com and we'll look at their traffic and their growth and you
can see that it's absolutely Ely outrageous so they've grown from a million traffic back in May to 22.4
million traffic as you can see right here I think as more people are posting articles directly on Twitter
and the easier it becomes to create content with Gro and then post it the moreo traffic Twitter is going
to get and the easier it's going to be rank to rank with this content so something to bear in mind right
here atram says is Gro connected to the internet can it scrape Google search results I don't think it can
let's double check and we'll try it together so I'm going to try it right now I'm going to say what are the
top 10 results on the first page of Google for perplexity a something like that we'll see what it comes
back with and you can see that it just guesses so it's not connected to the internet just to confirm
definitely not connected to Google and you can see that it cannot scrape or connect with the first page
of Google really good question though acram great point right there and rapael says that link for free
grock doesn't work they have many LMS there but not Gro so this is if you want to get access to Gro
right let me just type it in right here we'll find the example right here so the model that is grock 2 on lmis
is sus column R right and this is available inside the chatbot AR as you can see right here and so if you
want to get access to it just go to the LM Arena and then find the sus column r model right here as an
example of that here's me in the LM Arena on the model sus column R and I can use that as you can
see right here and put in my prompts directly down here and that's how you can get access to grop two
for free as you can see inside the chatbot Arena I'm confirming it for you I've shown you how to do it
that's how you do it Vanessa says thanks for your input about grock happy to help and glad that this
content helps you goal says for Twitter articles if your starting point is a blog post would you duplicate it
as an article on Twitter or does that count as duplicate content if so how would you use Twitter in this
instance so here's how I would use Twitter number one every time you post something new on a new
platform make sure that your content is unique right so for example if you're posting to Reddit or you're
posting to LinkedIn or you're posting to your website or to medium or to Twitter make sure your content
is unique every single time and then from there you can use this workflow right here which you can see
for example you can get the keywords using this method then you can create the content with AI using
this method from there you can publish it and from there you can Syndicate it using these two
automated tools is it spam no you're using the SEO checklist that I've given away many times inside my
content and so that's basically how it works as an example of that if we go onto a keyword like
perplexity AO you can see that the content that I've created and ranked on the first page of Google is
unique every time and that's the key it's got to be unique because if it's duplicate content it will not rank
so for example you can see this YouTube video ranking then this one on the first page these are
created by myself and then from here you can go down and you can click on these example pages and
if we do that you can see that the content I've posted on medium is unique to the content that I've
created on LinkedIn two totally unique articles two totally different sets of content that's how you would
use it Good Vibes only says can you access LM Arena through API automation ideas for posting latest
news is crazy with Gro big love man so from what I've seen you cannot get the API through LMC Arena
the way to do it is to get the API directly from grock so if you type in API grock on Google you'll get the
access to the API but the problem is it's not the API from grock 2 because that's still in beta and the API
for grock 2 has not been released yet I think they're planning to release it on Enterprise API plans but
right now you can't get access access to it and so there's only the older version of Gro which I still think
is okay but it's nowhere near as impressive as grock 2 right now to be honest with you let's have a look
what else I wanted to cover in this video as we go along and yeah I'm I'm just pretty impressed with Gro
I think it it will be a powerful way to generate content in the future particularly if you're in the news space
and particularly if you're thinking about okay how do we use this step by step now this is a grock page
so this is a grock API page as you can see right here and if you want to see the full details and the
breakdown and the benchmarks of Gro you can see it inside this particular article you see grock 2 Beta
Page 27
release and it says grock 2 is our Frontier language model with State the art reasoning capabilities this
includes two members of the grock family grock 2 which is a separate model so this is not the model I'm
showing you today because grock 2 is not the model of grock 2 mini right and so grock 2 mini is what
I've got access to and then grock 2 I believe will be released later and that'll probably be even better
and crazier the other thing that I would say with Gro and I didn't really mention this earlier is that Gro is
pretty quick to respond so if we go back onto grock and we'll create a new chat as you can see and
we'll just click on one of these random things like help me write a cover letter you can see that the
actual responses really fast so it actually responds really quickly when it comes to creating content
that's another Pro now as we scroll down you can see how GR to Performance in terms of chat
capabilities right so if we go down here you can see this is the model sus column R and in terms of Elo
scores on the chatbot Arena so this is voted on by real people you can see that Gro comes in at
number four number one is chat gp40 number two is Gemini 1.5 Pro number four is Gro right there and
then there's a bunch of other models underneath now the other thing you can see here is you can see
the win rate of grock 2 against competing models on chatbot Arena so for example the win rate of grock
2 is 70% versus deep seek and yeah these are some more benchmarks so you can see exactly how
grock 2 mini performs versus GPT 40 mini uh sorry GPT 40 turbo claw 3 Opus Gemini 1.5 llama 3 point
and GPT 40 as well so it's not too far behind but I still don't think it's as good as chat GPT for for
creating content and that's how you get access to it so that's pretty much it I think in terms of the whole
thing that I wanted to show you in terms of how this works as well Jason says blim me this is just insane
if you don't see the value Julian's given your yeah yeah something like that and Dr Z says is the content
created with Gro unique plagiarism free that is a great question we can have a look we'll run it through
a plagiarism Checker right now so I'm going to log into originality in the background which is one of the
best places I can check for plagiarism I'm imagining that the content will come out highly AI generated
but I also imagine that it will be plagurism free most of the time so if we come back to this prompt that
we were talking about earlier and this is the document with all the notes if we come back to this prompt
and we'll take this one right here we'll plug that into grock we'll paste it in right there and then we'll get it
to generate some content and once it's generated that content we can run it through a plagiarism check
on originality and see how it performs right so we'll click on detect Ai and we'll click on check plagiarism
and from here we've got the content and it's just blasting out but again it's very much bullet pointed it's
very much it feels AI even when I look at it right I don't even have to read it to know that this probably
isn't great for content creat the other thing that I would say right here is that it doesn't even insert
internal links you can see that it doesn't insert internal links unlike I instructed it too so that's something
to bear in mind as well it may just be that Gro doesn't do very well with longer prompts and so if you
gave it a shorter more simpler prompt it might give you a better output so we're going to wait for this
now and we'll give it a Content scan and just see how it performs now whilst we're waiting for that we're
ask answer Dr Z he says is there API option in grock to use it outside the platform like open AI so you
can get access to the API if you type in Gro API SDK on Google you will see the developer platform
right there and then you can get the API details right there but again right now until it's released this is
purely for the older version of Gro so grock version one one right it's not for the new version so
something to be aware of right there and you can see if we look at the plagiarism score this is I
predicted right I was just spot on I should be Mystic Meg with a crystal ball here you can see the inside
the plagiarism score it is 0% plagiarized so that's what I expected because I've never really seen AI
content come out as a as plagiarized just never seems to be an issue but if we go to the AI results and
as I predicted it's likely to be AI right 100% confidence that it is AI so if it's obvious to originality probably
going to be obvious to Google or anywhere else you create content whether it's quality content or not I
wouldn't say it is right if you look at the content itself I think it needs a lot of editing and when you've got
options like claw 3.5 Sonic for free then that's probably a much better option versus creating content
directly on Gro so yeah comes out 100% AI generated comes out 0% PL and we're going to keep going
through some of the questions says is there a free option so there is a free option at LM Arena just go
to LM arena. and then go to the model called sus column R right there and that's basically it so if you
want to get access to the video notes from today including the sap all the links I've talked about Etc you
