biceps quads arms like here chest I don't know if I can say this on camera you can say whatever you
want today I'm answering the most important question known to Jim Bros worldwide what is the one
muscle girls find most attractive to find out I'm surveying over 200 girls to accurately determine which
muscle ranks the highest and which ones they just don't seem to care for at the end I'll also reveal the
one unexpected personality trait that actually outperformed all the muscles we surveyed but to start
things off I want to first ask the guys what muscle they believed most girls would pick do we really
understand what women want well this is obvious isn't it I don't know is it a well-rounded physique you
got to pick one muscle shoulders nice broad shoulders yeah shoulders we're looking for that Dorito look
you know what I mean that like triangle it's basically what makes up your frame you know what I mean
bro classic biceps back I think back cuz like you know fills you up a little bit more and you can see it
from further away I'm going to say Chas yeah chest broadens you out of bit quite a thing to to admire to
appreciate quads quads the booty booty yeah how important is the booty on a guy really important how
would you rank his booty oh two abs abs yeah no girls yeah I'll take Cal or deltoids cves a lot of girls
love the Cales look at his CES I can see dude these are literally the biggest CS I've ever seen in my life
after talking to the guys our leading predictions were chest and shoulders which means it's finally time
to start talking to some ladies but I'm going to need some assistance this is Max Max has one of the
best proportion physiques I know and is going to be our muscle model for the day just in case the girls
need a visual reference before making their choice what Max doesn't know is I'm secretly playing
Matchmaker today Max is as nice as he is buff and he's single too so as we interview girls for science
let's see if we can find find someone truly special for him in case you're wondering this is Max he's our
muscle model for the day clearly very well built if you could pick one muscle on the guide that's most
attractive what would you pick traps okay these guys are here yeah yeah CH number one and and why
is that I don't know I just like find that really attracting probably their arms arms biceps arms yeah
maybe ABS would be like a second best kind of thing probably ABS just like them how would you rank
his traps show show them what's going on okay yeah like a nine like pretty yeah you're up there how
would you rate his chest seven seven s I'll take it ah pretty good I mean could be bigger are you single
yeah you are yeah okay the great thing is Max over here is also single oh so I don't know maybe you
could exchange numbers you know maybe fre me here what do you mean you freck me here I have a
boyfriend I am unfortunately are you sing you are single Max is uh he's also single you'll find someone
believe in you you you are brutal keep walking around turns out our first couple attempts didn't quite go
as planned and even though Max is in amazing shape he's also incredibly shy yeah well for the record
Jeremy didn't give me a heads up that I would be asking girls give me my give me their number today
so so it's good I feel like I need to be put on the spot more it's uh it will help me grow as a person what's
your type uh a girl who goes to the gym all right Jim girls where you at and while I was failing in my role
as a wingman we were at least getting some really valuable answers from the girls shoulders probably
shoulders and what about yourself um probably back back really yeah and why is a um my boyfriend
works on his back like quads quads you were quick with that I know what I like shoulders for sure yeah
uh let's say shoulders shoulders yeah kind of just gives them that nice frame probably the chest the
pectoral muscles chest yeah and why is that cuz it makes you look like bigger you take up more room I
don't know okay what is it about quots I just it shows like lower body takes a little bit more time uh to
build and so I don't know not everyone's blessed with big legs I person like a guy that has bigger legs
than me so what what is it that makes the the triceps the back of the arms so attractive I have no idea
it's just yeah it's like a really pretty muscle probably arms biceps biceps that's what I said did you did
you speak that to her no what what is it about biceps that makes soci I don't know I just I don't know if I
can say this on camera you can say whatever you want just big arms ni in addition to having the girls
picking their number one muscle I also had them rate each muscle on a scale of 1 to 10 with being the
most attractive after we get enough data I'll be using a scientific tool called Anova to determine which
muscle is not just most attractive but if it actually reaches statistical significance this way we can
Page 66
confidently say if certain muscles are genuinely more attractive and which muscles aren't you put
calves as one can you uh explain this is good news for guys though are the hardest muscle for for most
guys to grow I just don't think it's that important like I'm like always looking at your face so like looking
down at like your calves I'm just like go I don't think it's that no I don't think it's that important a lot of
girls love the Cs and at this point I was already finding one muscle group that was doing surprisingly
worse than I expected shoulders nine ABS six really I'm not going to look at a guy and be like oh he has
no abs like no abs are last yeah ABS I don't really care about ABS really if you just eat a bit less they
show a little bit more where like you have to like really put in the work to like grow your quads and
glutes and chest abs are over you hear that but before you guys ditch the diet and jump on a bulk for
the rest of your life I did notice something interesting with the data although on average abs are scoring
low when I count how frequently girls were picking ABS as the most attractive muscle it's actually in the
top three suggesting that while on average girls don't really seem to care much for abs the ones who do
really find them attractive and score them as a 10 which just goes to show you that even if a muscle
doesn't score high on our study there's still someone out there who may be attracted to just that Cals
would be like close second what is it about CS I have no idea but I think they're so beautiful if a guy has
a good set of Cs on him a lot of girls love the Cs this is a really underrated muscle but for me be the
bracho radialis muscle oh my God most people don't even know what that is so it's a muscle right here I
mean I can demonstrate all show show her show her so like Flex this muscle right here if you have this
your hands are also really nice it's like overall like a really nice I guess it shows like your hard working
very Hands-On yeah and how important do you think muscles are on a gut um as someone that goes to
the gym I find them important so yeah what makes them important um like healthy lifestyle look fit yeah
just overall good Wellness okay I think that's attractive nice yeah and uh if you could rank his muscles
on a 10 would you give him like an eight they're putting an effort they show up for you in ways you need
them to Max showed up for me today and I really needed him so he he exhibits that quality and he he is
also single are you single I am single are you single yes I am you are yeah okay well the great thing is
Max is also single here and he's he's looking he's not only good-looking kills it in the gym but he's
honestly one of the sweetest people I know show her your breaking where out one more time it's very
nice 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 okay is that good enough to get your number may I have your number
he's on one knee he's already on one knee of course I'll give you my number with Max's body and my
skills as a wingman I was finally able to set max up with some potential first dates but how much of his
success was coming from his muscles well this goes back to our ancestral times back then strong
muscles showed that a man could protect and support his family but it wasn't just about in ability since
building muscle needs protein rich food it meant that these men were good Hunters too so today even
though most men get muscles at gyms rather than hunting attraction to muscles should still be
hardwired into their DNA how important do you think like muscularity is when it comes to oh no it's not
important no really well that's deep question it probably can move up like say like one point on a scale
on to 10 that's the first thing that draws me in and then the personality will keep me there I wouldn't say
it's like super important it's not that important for me but like you said for some people it's very important
well I'm slightly bias cuz I'm in the fitness industry so I understand that it takes a lot of discipline and a
lot of work to get a muscular physique and I personally strive to have that so I think for me it's without a
doubt very important it is important for attraction I guess like a bonus but it's not like yeah okay I would
just say as long as they take care of themselves I think is important where they stand in their fitness
journey I don't think is super relevant to me as long as they're pursuing it yeah is that what like initially
attracted you to to him no no really but but it it helps it it does sure does now while having some muscle
was definitely seen as positive by almost every girl we spoke to they were generally seen as far less
important than what most guys predicted so if you are hitting the gym you're probably better off picking
a goal that's important to you rather than just trying to impress girls now I won't say muscle doesn't help
but in my experience it typically leads to a lot more compliments from Jim Bros rather than the ladies as
for the results of our survey we managed to collect over 50 responses from our interviews on the beach
but based on a statistics tool called G power it recommended we aim for at least 200 to make our
results statistically valid so after sending out a quick online survey we had all the data we needed and
here's what we found Cavs came in at the the very bottom of our survey with only three first place votes
out of 205 responses as it turns out not a lot of girls really love calves next were glutes legs and abs
Page 67
now while these muscles significantly outperform calves their scores will still much lower than the upper
body muscles chest back and shoulders however the differences between these three muscles didn't
quite reach statistical significance so although I'm confident I can't for sure say that nice shoulders are
objectively more attractive than back or chest muscles however there was one muscle that reached
statistical significance when compared to all the other muscles arms arms not only crushed the
rankings but it was also the first place vote for over 30% of the girls we surveyed but even though
building a ripped physique won't guarantee the girl of your dreams there was one personality trait that
outperformed every muscle we surveyed like you can have like be super funny sorry have a good
