URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPpb_0Ie-QU
in this Claude tutorial I going to give you 36 tips and tricks that take you from a beginner to a Master
within Claude now even if you've been prompting for a while and using large language models I highly
recommend you stick around to the end because I myself have prompted for hundreds of hours alone
perfecting my craft and there are a lot of things in this video that I share with you that I've learned over
the years of prompting in large language models so if you're ready to get into it grab out your coffees
get out your notepads and let's learn how to use Claude for those of you who don't know me my name
is Drake I've been teaching artificial intelligence for a couple of years now and I have an AI foundation's
University where it's a community a classroom a network and a live call group all in one platform this is
the best learning experience for AI I've learned more in the past 3 months than I have in the past two
years studying artificial intelligence alone thanks to this community and thanks to getting all of these
people from different Industries together in one platform and talking about AI now I'll leave a link to join
this in the description or the top end comment so if you like what you see in this video and you want to
dive deeper into learning with us here at AI foundations highly recommend starting at the community it's
an amazing experience you'll gain a network of people to talk about AI with and it's meant to be your
final stop in the community we're talking about AI news all day long I mean people are posting multiple
times per hour we have a classroom full of different courses to learn large language models AI image
Generations Automation and more courses to to come soon we have a calendar even with a bunch of
different live calls and we do multiple different styled calls per week we have live q&as; we have
money-making methods with AI and of course you get the community class rooming calendar so I
highly recommend you join if you are interested in anything artificial intelligence I'll leave a link in the
top pend comment and the description below if you're interested in joining and without further Ado let's
get into these 36 claw tips and tricks tip number one is to split your tasks when using Claud often times
we send off these long prompts that are very very detailed and we can't get as much out of Claude
when we don't split up our tasks I'm going to show you an example of what that means to split tasks
let's say I'm dealing with this long prompt in Claude And I want to create a YouTube channel in the
artificial intelligence space and I want Claude to help me along the way well here's my prompt it says I
need help creating the YouTube channel in the artificial intelligent space please help me come up with
30 catchy names and describe why each one is good also I would like 10 Channel description
variations that are General in regards to Ai and also describe why those are good as well for each one
and why they might work better than others lastly I would like you to put together a Content calendar
and strategy with mock video ideas and days of the week I should be posting on now these are all
amazing tasks for Claud to complete and each one has their purpose let me split them up real quick so
we have our goal up top we need help creating a channel next what we want is 30 catchy names and
we want Claude to describe why each name is is good the next thing we want is 10 Channel description
variations and then finally we want a Content calendar and strategy with Mack video ideas these are all
great tasks once again but when we send off this prompt Claude can only go into each one of those
tasks so much because of its token limit and how much it can actually generate per output as you can
see it's completed my request it has the 30 caty Channel names with describing why each one is good
it gave me 10 Channel description variations it gave me a calendar and strategy but it's only going so in
depth on each task because it has to think about and move on to the next task so tip number one is to
split up each of these tasks so Claude can expend more of its output limit on that specific task so
instead of me asking all of these questions at once maybe I should ask them one at a time and this is if
you're trying to get detailed and good responses so I can keep my goal and then I can start a new chat
and then I can just give it one command at a time and I can even tell it to be more detailed and go into
spefic specific things about that task maybe instead of getting detailed about your entire project get
super specific into one task that way it can expend its energy and its output limit into that specific task
so now I'm just sending off this 30 catchy names prompt I still have the same goal but I'm just having it
do one task at a time and I'm having it be super detailed on the descriptions of why each channel name
Page 83
might be good and attractive for viewers and once I send this off you can just see how detailed it went
into every single name and it really helps me when it comes to making a decision for my YouTube
channel based in the artificial intelligence Niche I mean just take a look at this one task how many
output tokens it expended so what I've done is I've taken these two prompts and I've put them in a
Google doc and what I want to do is compare the word count when we split a task versus when we
don't split a task so when we didn't split a task and we wanted our 30 catchy Channel names this is how
in-depth it went let's take a look I can go to tools and word count as you can see it gave me 334 words
into this specific task when I sent this task off to Claude on its own it went much more in depth as you
can see we have 1,59 words compared to 334 so this is the more in-depth explanation you're going to
get when you start to split up your tasks and CLA tip number two is to use pictures for context you can
do this for so many different use cases let me show you a few examples now let's say you have a otion
database or a Google sheet where you track your sleep maybe you're using an API to do so and you're
pulling in your sleep seconds but you want to actually convert that to a nicer format that's easier for you
and I to understand rather than just seeing your time and seconds now this is just an example of how
you could use a picture for context because right now we have the sleep tracking database and when
you're creating a formula property in notion you need to type in all of this code and it sometimes get
difficult but in this instance you could give Claude more context by providing it a picture and you can
even draw on that picture and Circle C certain elements to show Claude what you're talking about so if I
just grab my basic Snipping Tool here and I hit new and take a screenshot I could screenshot exactly
what I'm talking about and I can leave some room underneath it to draw and now I could Circle
elements that I want to talk about such as my property here maybe I can Circle the property that I want
transformed and then I could write out the format that I want the seconds in maybe I'll just give Claude
an example of how I want this format such as this maybe I want these seconds to be converted into to
this right here 7 hours and 28 minutes instead of whatever these seconds are now I could save this
image and upload it to Claude for context so now in Claude when I have a prompt I don't have to give
as much context into what I'm speaking of in the form of text but rather as a picture so I can say help
me create a formula in notion that converts seconds into the format shown in the image my notion
properties are in the image as well I can even put they are circled because this is the property we have
to use if we want the formula to work proper l so now I can just hit add content beneath here once I
have my prompt and then I can upload my image so I can go to my notion photo hit open and now
Claude has this it sees what's circled it sees the format I wanted in and now we can watch Claude do its
magic and go to work using this picture as context as you can see it gave me the notion formula with
my exact properties that I needed because I uploaded that picture and I could type it out but there's a
lot more room for error that way so now when I go in here and I paste in my formula and hit done it
converts all of those just as we had asked based on the image that we uploaded you could do this with
Google Sheets you could do this with posting you could do this with literally whatever even color
palettes maybe you like the design of a certain website what you could do is you could screenshot that
website and say give me the code to replicate this and you don't have to really describe what it is that
you want replicated you just have to upload the picture for further context tip number three is to upload
website documentation for context if there's a new tool or a new app or something that goes Super
in-depth uploading the documentation to Claude really allows it to dig into your problems and find you
much better Solutions let me show you what I mean let's say I'm using a tool like make.com make.com
is a tool where you can go in and you can automate certain things you have scenarios in here that you
can run that perform one task after another after another we teach this in the AI foundations Community
but it's really fun and at the same time it's complex and when I want to ask Claude questions about it I
want to make sure that it knows all of the updates details about this program that I'm using you can do
this with anything any tool that you use just go to your documentation such as this page that I have right
here and copy everything maybe I'm working with the API so I want to go to the API documentation
what I could do is I could copy this entire page as you can see I'm just scrolling down and copying all
the documentation it's pages and pages of information when you ask Claude questions now about
make or whatever tool you're getting the documentation from it's it's going to dive much further into
detail and know everything about it especially when you get into specific things like API documentation
it's important that Claude has upto-date information on that so you can perform tasks and ask it
Page 84
questions more accurately so as you can see I'm still scrolling it's been about 30 to 45 seconds now of
just scrolling but this is going to be an amazing example to show you how well of a job Claude can do at
actually Gathering all of this data and using it and we can actually ask questions about it so as you can
see we finally made it to the end and I'm just going to let go of my mouse and now I'm going to hit contrl
C you can even rightclick your documentation that you have highlighted and copy it I forgot that last
example here but that'll be okay and then I can head back over to Claude And all I have to do now is hit
control+v and what that's going to do is make a file for you and it's going to upload it as pasted text so
now Claude is going to use this documentation for context and it's all 637 lines everything in the make
API documentation that we would need to know so this is awesome it got literally everything and now
Claude is going to be much more ready to help with our project and now that I have that in here I can
just ask it questions about the make API documentation and the questions don't have to be about the
API documentation but how I can use the documentation to complete a certain task in the program that
I need to so let's just say I have a use case that I need for filtering and make.com I could ask clot a
question about that now since it has all the documentation what is filtering and how do I use it and now
that it has all this information it will be able to answer it much more in depth without even me having to
mention that I'm using make.com I can send that off and it's now using the documentation provided it
says based on the documentation provided here's an example of filtering so you can kind of
communicate with data and documentation that's a lot harder to understand on your own with just
pasting that documentation into CLA so this one's super important whenever you need more context
take pictures use tip number two and use tip number three which is to upload the documentation for
even further context context is so important that's why I wanted to touch on it early because it allows
you to explain to Claude what your problem is in a much more efficient manner tip number four is to use
Claude for brainstorming you can brainstorm literally anything from personal things to business tasks
let me show you an example of that now let's say I have a bachelor party coming up and I'm the one
who needs to be planning it well I could have Claude help me brainstorm as you can see I say help me
brainstorm 10 unique bachelor party ideas for my brother make these ideas so he will always
remember this day I can send it off and even if I don't want to use these ideas at the least it's inspiration
for something I could do later down the line and you can keep on asking questions diving further into
this as you can see it gave me 10 different ideas extreme sports day mystery Adventure survival skills
racetrack Private Island historical reenactment zero gravity f it just keeps on going with all of these
different ideas very cool unique ideas but how do I know that these are actually going to work work well
I could followup prompt and ask another question I say give me a probability of success percentage
rate for each of these ideas and then give me a top three based on the percentage of success results
maybe I want to see can I pull this off we can use Claude to further the brainstorming process I'm going
to send that off and now it's going to organize these in a probability of success percentage rate and it's
going to show me okay which one of these are most likely to actually work and then it's going to give
me top three ideas based on that previous list I could even go fur further into the brainstorming process
don't think about this for personal things think about it for business use cases or social media posting or
advertising SEO you can compare you can brainstorm uh I'm going to bring another prompt in here just
to show you how you can further the brainstorming process I say based on these top three results add
an additional idea that could compete with these ideas in the top three so I'm now having Claude add a
completely new idea to the list that could potentially compete with these top three at the end I'm just
going to add make this an idea we haven't yet seen I'm going to send that off and now we're going to
get a completely new idea generated and it added in virtual reality World Tour 91% probability of
success so that's going to take the second place spot based on these top three tip number five is to
plan anything in Claude this can be big events for corporate things this can be small personal events
let's just keep building on last example and plan out this bachelor party idea that we just got generated
for my brother maybe I liked this idea that Claude generated the mystery Adventure I'm just going to
copy that and I can start a new chat with Claude now we're going to use Claude to actually plan we did
the brainstorming now let's use another tip and plan something with Claude I'm just going to paste that
in there so I don't forget it and then I'm going to bring in another prompt that I created a little earlier for
planning so I have this prompt right here and I'm just listing out some details for Claude to build off of
I'm giving the specifics what we already have plannned so it can for one watch any spots and for two it
Page 85
can help me plan my day in the most efficient manner possible if you're dealing with checklist this is
also great to help to have Claude help engineer your day so that you're getting things done in an
efficient manner okay let's take a look at this it says I'm planning a bachelor party for my brother I'm
laying out the environment here's the idea this is where I want to list out my idea so I can list out my
idea I can copy this that we got generated with Claude funny enough and I can paste it in so my idea is
the mystery Adventure I can get rid of that probability of success score and I I'll just have offering
excitement uh unpredictability while being adaptable to various preferences and budgets and then I
give more details I give the location of where we're doing this let's just say Phoenix Arizona the length
of stay the number of men for this bachelor party eight including my brother ages ages is important
everyone's 21 plus where we are sleeping airb be and Phoenix and then this is where the secret sauce
comes in I say provide me with a full itinerary and exact time based on my idea and then I can say help
me watch for any blind spots on this special day as well so now it's going to look out for me it's going to
say hey you might want to look out for this or maybe the schedule might misalign with somebody's
interest whatever it may be it'll watch for those blind spots and I'm going to send this off and get this
entire complex day planned and it gives me the entire itinerary in a matter of seconds I don't even have
to think about it now I can revise things in Claude I can use this schedule I can use parts of it now I
have all these ideas and it just takes the stress out of planning those big events and it gets it down by
the hour 12:00 p.m. 1:00 p.m. 2:30 4:30 6:30 9:12 and it gives me it for both days that I had planned in
Phoenix gives me all sorts of activities to do on this mystery Adventure bachelor party and then it gives
me 10 blind spots to look out for transportation reservations backup plans pacing dietary restrictions
and it keeps on going on and down the list about things that I might not think of but they're important to
think of because they are things that often come up during events such as this tip number six is to build
your own tools in Claude these can be personal tools for little games with you and your friends or this
can be professional tools like SEO tools or analytics tools you can really do it and get a base version
built by using the claw artifacts feature and then you can furthermore ask it how to implement it into
your website and the list goes on I mean you can really do what ever with the code that it provides you
but building your own tools in Claw is awesome because it gives you that preview window that you can
test your tool out essentially and later down the line we're going to learn how to publish that tool as well
so stick around for that tip but let's get into it let's say that me and my friends are out golfing on the on
the golf course right it's a beautiful day but we're getting the little out of hand we're not really liking our
scores so we decide okay I want to do a random Club challenge let's do it so each shot we hit on the
golf course we need a random Club selector that selects the club for us and that's the club we use well
we could build a tool in claw that does just that I can just say use react and inline CSS this is important
must use react and inline CSS Tailwind CSS Styles will not work that's just something you have to do if
you do want to build these artifact tools that are functional and then I say use that to build a tool that
generates a random Golf Club to use for each shot with the click of a button being specific that I want to
click a button and generate a random Golf Club to use I say this tool with golf style branding SF fonts
Country Club green and clean colors you can even get as fancy The Styling as you want I'll keep it
simple for now but let's send this off and let's get this entire tool built with Claude the beautiful thing
about doing this with Claude is it does it so quick and you can kind of bring your small ideas to life some
of those things where it might not be out there on the market and you just want to build it quick custom
small tool for you and your friends or something for your business you know I've built an SEO Wiz tool
that helps me analyze my prompts and fill it with keywords uh based on my Niche you can do things like
that but here we have this golf club selector I can hit select random club and it gives me a random Club
to use so let's say let's say I'm teaing off now I'm on the T box and I want to hit my first shot me and all
my friends are gathering around my laptop that I brought out on the golf course and using it with starlink
to get this golf club selector built when we don't have Internet let's say they're all surrounding me here
and I'm about to tea off all right I'm going to select a random club guys three iron three iron off the tea
box not bad not bad maybe my other friend goes and we hit select random club driver perfect off the tea
box my other friend goes six iron not so great depending on your hole but you get the point you can
build out these little tools with Claude and actually edit them as well I'm not going to get into the editing I
have a full video 15 use cases for Claude where I get into a little bit more on how you can edit this stuff
but it's simple you just ask Claude for revisions now we've been learning a lot of tactics with Claude but
Page 86
let's get into the organization side of things tip number seven is to rename your chat logs in Claude in
order to stay a little bit more organized you have the ability to rename things and sometimes when you
get generating a bunch of different information it's important that you stay organized otherwise you're
going to be searching around all of your chats just as I have in the past so make sure that you organize
your chat logs and you can do that by renaming them and giving them specific names or you can
organize them numerically whatever you want to do you can rename them so if I go to my recent chats
by opening up my sidebar or by just hitting show right here on the homepage I can click into one of
those chats let's just click into the mystery Adventure bachelor party maybe I want to rename this so it
doesn't say mystery Adventure up front all you have to do is click on your chat at the top of your screen
and then hit rename it's as simple as that but this is going to help with organization so maybe I could
put 01 then I could put bachel party ideas for and then brother name maybe I just put Carter and then
hit save now this is looking like this compared to mystery adventure and it starts with all this weird text
um it's definitely going to help organize your chats tip number eight is to understand the different
models that you have access to in claw some people might be using a certain model for certain tasks
and it may not be performing as good as another model might be or maybe you need things done a little
quicker and you want the prompts and the outputs to come out a little bit faster then you might need to
switch your model do you want it to be better at C C might need to switch your model uh there's just
certain things you have to keep in mind when using Cloud's models as you can see beneath your
prompt bar we all have this model selector where you can choose between Claude 3.5 Sonet Claude 3
Opus and Claude 3 Hau they have little descriptions underneath but you can go more in depth on
claud's website as you can see Claude 3.5 Sonet is the most intelligent model Claude 3 Opus excels at
writing and complex tasks while Claude 3 ha cou is the fastest model for daily tasks so if you need
quick things without complex reasoning you probably want to do this if you want to generate some
quick text or just something that doesn't require complex reasoning that might be your model if you're
doing some creative writing from what I've heard Claude 3 Opus is much better at creative writing in our
AI foundations Community people have been saying who are writing books with Claude that Opus is
much better at creative writing and following those instructions while I know myself that Claude 3.5
Sonet is much better at the coding if you want a more in-depth look you can go to anthropics website to
and take a deeper look at the models and some of the upcoming models that they have which is very
exciting to think about so as you can see 3.5 Sonet is out but they're also going to be releasing 3.5
Opus later this year and 3.5 ha coup so very very excited for what's to come and you can kind of go and
read a little bit more about this every single one of them have text and image input and uh text output
with a 200,000 context window but they perform a little bit differently per model you can go down and
look at the model names as you can see this is a very nice model comparison showing the
improvements that 3.5 Sonet had on the market as you can see it just outperformed Opus on the
intelligence benchmark scores and also cost less money when it comes to development and here
there's a big list of descriptions strength and just checklist things that they go through along with costs
and training data cut offs I'll just lightly scroll down so you can pause the screen and read which model
is good for what but yes make sure that you understand which model you're using to see if it's the best
one for your use case tip number nine is to make sure that you're specifying your output format in CLA
because a lot of the time people just stick to generic text but they don't know about the special
formatting options that come with using a large language model and when using Claude as your large
language model I think they do the output formatting side of things very well let me show you a few
examples so I could type out a like give me the top 10 dog breeds based on friendliness and cost and I
can send it off and as you can see it's just going to be that generic basic text output that we are very
used to seeing but it doesn't have to be like this now these number lists are very useful and they have
their place but what if I wanted this in a bullet list I could say give me this in a bullet list you have to be
very specific for what you want CU Claud can't read your mind on what you want so now it's giving it all
this information to me within a bullet list how about a table yes you can do tables in CLA too I can say
now a table and it doesn't stop there with the output formatting you don't just have to do a table format
you don't just have to do a bullet list numbered list but you can also add in things like special character
such as Bolding so I could say keep the table but bold the dollar amount so maybe I want that dollar
amount bolded so it stands out a little bit more it can do that so now as you can see over here on the
Page 87
right the dollar amounts are bolded and you can do this especially when it comes to editing your work
you can say bold the statements that you changed if you're using it for enhancing your writing so output
formatting is something you definitely want to keep in mind what do you want what special formatting
do you want how do you want your information presented to you be specific and keep this in mind when
prompting in Claude tip number 10 is to follow up prompt in Claude you know a lot of people don't even
take the time to prompt after their initial response they think that that's where they have to stop they're
all good maybe they don't get a response they like and then they quit using large language models
that's the unfortunate truth is a lot of people stop after the first prompt but you can use follow-up
prompting to do three things analyzing understanding and expanding on your output I'll show you an
example of each of those now so I could ask Claude to create me a list of the 15 most popular
marketing strategies I could send that off and as you can see it will give me a concise list of 15 popular
marketing strategies let's say I want to go in-depth on one of those I can ask a follow-up prompt and I
can ask a follow-up prompt to analyze understand or expand how about we analyze first what I can say
is create me a table view of these strategies listing the pros and cons this is going to help me analyze
which one is best by taking a look at the pros and cons of each and if it doesn't help me come to a
direct solution or a direct answer at the least it will broaden my view of the ups and downs of each
strategy so I can send off this analyzing follow-up prompt and as you can see it gives me the strategy
and then it gives me the pros over here and also the right now when you see this that's just a line break
you can just ignore that but yes very good gives me the cons gives me the pros and this might help me
weigh out my options when looking for a marketing strategy to use let's take a look at an understanding
follow-up prompt how can we use a follow-up prompt to further understand a specific strategy in here
maybe I want to learn a little bit more about referral marketing well I could use this basic understanding
follow-up prompt now there are many different follow-up prompts for each stage analyzing
understanding and expanding I'm just showing you one for each category but what we have here is a
prompt to further help me understand this marketing strategy that I want to dive deeper into it says what
are the basic principles underlying the referral marketing strategy something as simple as that I can
send that off and this is going to help me further understand a specific strategy that I got generated this
is an example of an understanding prompt it now gives me 10 different principles of one of those
strategies let's do a prompt where we completely tear this apart by adding in a new Factor not tearing it
apart but actually expanding it right so out of all 15 of these what if I add in something like an industry I
can ask which of these strategies is most positively impacted by artificial intelligence and that's
definitely going to help me expand on this previous knowledge I'm going to send it off and it says
several are significantly impacted by AI but it would argue that personalization and targeted marketing
is most positively impacted by Ai and it doesn't just tell me which category it thinks is most affected but
it gives me 10 reasons into why it thinks that is most positively impacted by AI so maybe that's one that
I would want to tackle because I'm expanding and I'm trying to understand okay how is this thing that's
taking over the world right now going to affect these marketing strategies that are at the top of the list
right now and which one's going to take the cake and be the best Dynamic content creation predictive
analysis real-time decisioning cross Channel consistency it just gives a lot of good insight into why it
thinks that that one might be the best for the future tip number number 11 and one of my favorite tips in
this entire series is to analyze images this is where you can actually upload images to Claude and ask
questions gain insight and you can get very specific into the questions you're asking about these
images because Claude has computer vision it can see the images images have been labeled with
certain objects it can do object identification and so much more so let me just show you an example of
what that might look like so if you hit add content right here beneath your prompt bar you can actually
add images I'm just going to add a picture of these flowers that I took outside of my house I did this
actually yesterday when planning for this video it's just an image of some flowers I can ask specific
questions to Claude such as how many flowers are bloomed in this image now from this image I think I
can see around 23 to 25 different flowers bloomed or I think that's what Claude will say because some
of them are hidden behind others but you can ask how many flowers are bloomed and it will give you an
exact number on how many flowers it sees that are bloomed so I can just ask that question and send it
off with that picture uploaded and it says I count approximately 20 to 25 fully bloomed flowers in this
image and then it gives me more in-depth detail about what those flowers are it tells me what family it's
Page 88
from and describes exactly how it looks the flowers are growing in a cluster surrounded by multure
wood chips exactly correct I can say give me an exact estimate and it says I can confidently identify 23
fully open flowers in the image let's do another example you can also do object identification you don't
really have to just ask questions about the image but you can have Claud identify certain objects in the
image so I'm going to ask what type of plant is this and I'm going to upload yet another set of flowers
outside my house um this is a very cool Plant I I really don't even know what it is so this should be
some good insight for me too what type of plant is this maybe I want to plant more forgot what we
bought and uh we can go in depth with Claude and have it name things for us and it says this image
shows a lavender plant and it gives a description into why that's a lavender plant now let's do one more
with a picture from outside keep in mind you can do this for really anything it's not just plant and object
identification but you can do this for so many more things as I'm about to show you in next tip so now
I'm going to upload two images and I'm going to upload images of this baby cherry tree that we just
bought the other day let kind of buy those flowers in the yard I'm going to open that up and I just wanted
you to keep in mind that you can upload up to five images or files so I'm uploading multiple Ang angles
of this Quan and Cherry Tree let's see if it gets this right I'm going to send it off and it does a pretty
good job it says based on this image it appears to be a young cherry tree several characteristics
support this identification I mean this is just like a baby tree with very little information here and it gives
five things into why it might be that cherry tree and it just did an amazing job tip number 12 is to use
Claude to get styling advice now you can do this for things online online or in person it really doesn't
matter I'm going to show you an example for both so if we hop over in Claude once again and we go to
add content what I have is actually a picture of a website that I'm working on for AI foundations and
maybe I want some advice I can open that up I just took a screenshot of the homepage and what
Claude can do is it can actually give me styling advice or tell me to change certain text or elements
around the screen to make the website more attractive so I could type in a prompt and I could say be a
harsh critic on my website as this is important for visitors what should I improve on in regards to styling
on my hero section I can send that off and because Claude has this picture for context as we learned
earlier it will be able to give me styling advice and act as a Critic for my website so I can keep visitors
on the website for longer gives me tips about the contrast my typography my button design layout
balance responsiveness Whit space brand consistency and call the action prominence it's um just very
harsh and that's what I wanted it to be I told it to be harsh critic and it's giv me eight things I need to
improve based on this one picture it's giving me all of these tips that I can implement or at least if I don't
Implement them all I have ideas on what I could Implement to make it better and I might have some
things that catch my eye let's take an in-person example maybe in my room I have a wall that I want
changed I'm just going to upload this picture of my room and maybe this is actually my old video
background I used to film on if you watch my 36 tips and tricks for chat gbt video then you know that
this is the wall that I filmed it on but let's say I'm getting sick of it and I want to change I can ask Claude
to give me ideas based on the surrounding element so it'll be able to see the gray floor the Green
carpet the blue bean bag the gray walls the white ceiling and everything else to able to see all that stuff
so it can provide you with styling advice in person so I could type out a prompt and just say I'm getting
sick of this green faux grass ball in my room based on the surroundings what may be a good option for
an accent wall I can send that off and you can give Claude preferences that you have you can give it
ideas but I really like just letting llms do the work and just go crazy so it's giving me all these different
ideas wood paneling a warm natural wood accent dark paint color a deep rich color like navy blue
acoustic panels given the musical equipment in the room so as you can see it's taking in the guitars that
I have over here it's taking in this electronic drum set and it's saying hey maybe put some acoustic
panels up a gallery wall textured wallpaper industrial metal it's really just giving me so many different
ideas based on this one picture and it really depends on the picture as well if I were to upload a picture
with a different wall it might give me different ideas based on the surroundings and what it sees it gave
me the acoustic panels example because it saw the music equipment tip number 13 is to assign a role
to Claude this completely changes your output in a matter of a couple of words so let me show you just
an example real quick let's say I need help writing a birthday letter from my younger cousin Timmy it's
his ninth birthday I can send that off right I can make it boring I can keep the message in the classic
claw format and it's going to even open up a document for me and go crazy with it and give me what it
Page 89
included the tone is warm and playful what if we want the tone or the style in a different way well we
can do that by assigning a role so if I keep this birthday letter the same and I just assign the role of a
pirate you'll see how much it changes so I say keep the message the same but act as a pirate when
you say act as X or fill the shoes of X whatever it may be if you're giving Claude A Persona it will fill the
shoes of that persona it's just amazing so now I can say keep the message the same but act as a pirate
you can pause the screen and read this now and when I send it off and it changes the message to act
as a pirate you can pause and compare them against one another so as you can see it's saying things
now like aoy there young Timmy mecko shiver me timbers it's your ninth birthday already blow me
down time to be Sailing by f faster than a Clipper ship and a stiff breeze okay it's talking like a pirate
now because we gave it that role and we assigned it that message now let's do something a little bit
more serious this is one that I always love showcasing in my other courses but if I hit start a new chat
let's do something a little bit more fun we can say act as an emolog an etymologist is just somebody
who studies word origins through history so I could say act as an emolog with 10 plus years of
experience guide me through a word origin exploring sequence with short prompts and direct actions
for me to take I'm having it fill the shoes of a professional word origin expert an emist to be exact I can
send that off and now it's going to act like an etymologist it's saying Welcome to our atmology
exploration sequence I'll guide you through discovering the origins of words using short prompts and
direct actions let's begin and then it gives me five steps I can complete choose a word you're curious
about any word will do common or rare write down your chosen word try to guess its language of origin
don't worry if you're not sure know any related word that comes to mind and share your words so it's
guided me through this game and it's filling the shoes of a professional with this custom action I gave it
to take me through a word origin exploring sequence very cool stuff so I definitely recommend you
assign roles to whatever task you're working on to let Claude fill the shoes of that professional in that
specific industry staying on the assigning rule side of things tip number 14 is to use new Styles and
tones within your prompts to mix up your creative writing or to mix up your ad copy your SEO what
whatever it may be when you can assign a style or a tone which can be bundled up into a roll but when
you assign those things The Prompt changes drastically let me show you a few examples so here's an
example I can say write me a window washing advertisement that will just be my main prompt I'm using
so you can see how the style changes this is where the secret sauce comes in in the style of whatever
you want it to be in the style of you can do professionals you can do Hollywood industry leaders
whatever it may be you can write in that style so in for this example I'm just going to say in the style of
Shakespeare maybe you have a Facebook ad I could even say that write me a Facebook ad for
window washing and I can get rid of the word advertisement in the style of Shakespeare I can send that
off says here's a Shakespearean style Facebook ad for window washing hark ye Windows clouded and
obscure doth Mar the beauty of thy Noble home but fret not for remedy most sure awaits by the hands
that make glass clean as foam so it's kind of talking like Shakespeare and I am big pentameter now you
can even go the complete opposite I could say write me a window washing advertisement in the style of
Eminem the rapper I can send that off and now it's talking like Eminem the rapper otherwise known as
Slim Shady right it says yo listen up I got a message to deliver about a service that'll make your
windows quiver with cleanliness so fresh it'll make you shiver we're the real deal no amateurs or
beginners so it's going in that specific style it's very fun and it spices up your writing a lot now we've just
been doing Styles let's try a tone now right because the tone changes the mood of the writing this kind
of changes everything about the writing right it talks in a specific format or a specific way from
somebody in history but we can actually just change the tone to be adjectives right what kind of tone do
we want well I could write a window washing advertisement in a depressing tone okay I could send that
off and then it goes in and it says in a world where everything seems clouded and unclear we offer
temporary respite from your despair our window washing service won't fix your life but at least you'll see
the Gloom outside with perfect clarity it's just hilarious right and you can really play into this and use
tones and styles together and mix up your writing and make your outputs much better when using CLA
tip number 15 is to question your data you have the ability to upload a data set whether that be a PDF
CSV a doc an image right and you can actually question it ask Cloud questions about your data in order
to gain further insights this can be done in a very basic level or a more advanced level let me show you
an example so I could even ask a simple prompt like what is this dat and that could just be a question to
Page 90
start I could upload this data and then just get an answer for what it is even if you know what it is it's
good to just ask to see what Claude thinks of it I'm going to send this off and it gives me a complete
overview about what this data is it says it contains detailed information about 374 people including all of
these different metrics one of the metrics here listed under demographic information is occupation
maybe I want to ask a question about that I could say what are all of the occupations listed right
because it listed occupation is one of those metrics under demographic information so I could say what
are all the occupations that are listed and send that off and get an answer from claw that's directly
taken from the data quickly it gives me 11 of the occupations that are listed tip number 16 is to chart
your data whether you're doing line graphs bar graphs Scatter Plots it really doesn't matter if you have a
data set and you want interactive charts then watch this follow along and use the techniques that I'm
using in this prompt we can keep going within our previous chat thread where we asked what is this
data and we uploaded a CSV of all of this sleep and lifestyle data based on certain occupations it gave
us what the data was it was easy to question the data and just ask questions about it I asked what are
all the occupations listed within that CSV and it gave me all of these what if I want to go deeper into that
data set as you can see there's other things in here such as stress level blood pressure heart rate steps
occupation age there's so many different factors so what if I want to start comparing some of those
maybe I want to see correlation between occupation and stress level that might be interesting to see if
there's any connection there I could make a bar graph going over the average stress level of five of
these occupations and I can do that by typing in a prompt that says create me a bar graph using react
and inline CSS if you're going to create graphs make sure that you're using react and inline CSS and
you type in that prompt before you type in the requirements of your graph and then I say based on five
of the occupations and give me the averages of their stress level make the stress level on the y- axis
from 0 to 10 and list to five occupations in the x- axis I say make this graph pastel colored but don't use
yellow also make a dark mode we love the dark mode let's go I'm going to send this off and this would
be an example of charting your data in Claude and doing some light data analysis as you can see it
gives me this using react and inline CSS the bottom is cut off here but we could fix that really quick as
you can see the words are there if I highlight them and now we have interactive charts in Claude based
on the data set that we uploaded in the last tip and you can go much more in depth with this I have a full
video and actually a full course with an AI foundations a full six or seven modules just going over charts
and how you can use them in large language models but I'll leave that video I made on claw data
analysis in the upper right hand corner if that interests you tip number 17 is to change your appearance
you might be stuck in light mode or dark mode and not know how to change it well you about to find out
it's very simple stuff open up your sidebar and head down to your settings from there you can go to
appearance and you can either change it from system so whatever your computer's on light mode sorry
for blinding you or the coveted dark mode which Everyone is always loving nowadays love dark mode
I'm going to keep it there so you can watch the rest of this video without straining your eyes now you
might be thinking is that it is that all you can do with your appearance well there is something else you
can do if you go into any one of your chat threads for example my window washing advertisements
what you can do is you can go to these chat controls in the upper right hand corner and actually change
your chat Styles now we're going to get into chat controls a little bit later but you can change your chat
Styles and one of those chat Styles and the only chat style is your font you can leave it default you can
have it match your system font so as you can see it gives it more of that aerial look or what I really like
about Claud is they have a dyslexic friendly font built into their system so if I click that I'm sure if you
have dyslexia this is somewhat helpful but it makes the text dyslexic friendly so very very cool tip
number 18 is to quickly capture screenshots natively in Claude in order to give Claude further context
into what you're working on this can be done very quickly with a feature that's baked into the prompt bar
really like this one and I haven't even used it as much as I want to because I just discovered it I've
always wondered what this little camera here was until I hovered over and saw captured screenshot
this is something you can do to capture a quick screenshot of a different screen and have it
automatically uploaded to your CLA chat so let's just say I'm on my AI Foundation YouTube channel
over here looking at some things just to show you the power of this I could ask questions about these
12 videos here on the homepage very very quickly if I go to Claude and I hit this capture screenshot
button like this and I capture the tab that I want to take a picture of and hit share what that's going to do
Page 91
is screenshot that and automatically add it in here so now I can ask questions about this such as which
of these videos performed the best if I send it off Claude will be able to read that screen that quickly in
the time that I'm talking to you it'll be able to pull that information off the tab that I captured this is going
to be great if you're working on SEO or any other projects where it involves um taking a lot of
screenshots and it's actually going to give me the one with the most views 15 insane new use cases for
Claude Sonet 182,000 views making it the best performing video among the shown and it's taking that
screenshot just like that very quick very cool and I hope that helped speed up your workflow in clae a
little bit more tip number 19 is to export your chat logs in Claude you have the ability to actually export
all of your chats to your email so if you're somebody who likes having things backed up or you just like
having an extra copy of something then this tip is definitely for you this one is very simple what you
want to do is you want to head down to your claw sidebar and you want to select your profile from there
what you can do is you can go to settings and in settings you can go to account in account you have
the ability to export your data so what you want to do is you want to hit export data and what it's going
to do is actually send you an email with a link that is going to expire within 24 hours so this may take a
little bit of time as well to actually prepare the export and send it to your email but what you can do is
you can hit export data and then up in the upper right hand corner behind my head right now it says
export started now when I go to my email as you can see anthropic will send you a message and it says
your data is ready for download once you hit download data it will bring you to this downloading screen
where it says your export should begin downloading automatically which it does and all of my data has
just downloaded in a zip file in the upper right hand corner so I could then drag that zip out on my
desktop and I could hit open and now I have all of my conversations and the users for those
conversations as well and it actually is going to export your conversations and the users of those
conversations in Json so you could use another tool to extract that Json or turn that Json into text if
that's something that's easier to work with or even a CSV so you can upload it to a Google sheet or
something like that but that is how to export your data in Claude tip number 20 is to use Claude to
create color palettes whether you're a designer founder CEO entrepreneur really doesn't matter we're
always needing some color palette for something especially if you like working alone or if you do work
alone sometimes it's hard being that creative in your business and you need to create some color
palettes well Claude can help you do that with a single prompt let me show you how that works right
now now I can tell Claude to create me a color palette for my water bottle brand that filters dirty water to
clean water in 15 seconds giving it some insight into what I want a color palette created for so it can
take inspiration and design the palette around me and it doesn't just come up with a random palette
based on nothing this is going to help bring my brand to life I say use react and inline CSS to show this
color palette and give me the hex codes as well I can send that off and it gives me a nice color palette
that I could use for my brand it gives me a pure blue clean teal fresh Aqua earthy Brown and crisp white
I can even uh edit this color palette by adding in more information about my brand I can add in this My
slogan for the company is from muddy to miraculous clean water in 15 seconds flat does this change
the color palette at all and then I can send that off to see if certain slogans certain things about my
brand might influence my color palette and it looks like it added in an accent gold and changed around
the blue a little bit you can always go to the different versions of your new code by hitting this arrow
down at the bottom left hand corner as you can see see my pure blue actually looked like it stayed the
same but what it did was added in that accent gold and to be honest this color palette needs some work
because this doesn't look that great but it gives you ideas to build off of and you can say certain things
like make it pastel and just by saying make it pastel that color palette is beautiful I could even say make
it on a dark mode background and now we're really getting the brand built here you can just keep on
going through these different uh variations of your color palette and just really design something nice tip
number 21 is to create projects and Claw this is where things start really taking off and when you start
understanding these tips and features that are to come in this video then you're going to be a CLA
Master CLA projects are an amazing way to organize your work provide different custom instructions
project knowledge and this is really going to get you ahead in the world of large language models
something you need to learn in order to create a project first and foremost you have to be on the
professional plan of Claude which it's just definitely worth it when you have access to these projects as
a matter of fact I have two clot accounts because I want to keep using it and my token liit runs out after
Page 92
using Claude so much even in this video I've had to move to the second account but in order to create a
project hover over Claude in the upper leth hand corner and go to projects very simple I've got a ton of
these little projects in here think of these projects like folders you can name these projects give them
descriptions you can sort them by recently created or recent activity doesn't really matter whatever way
you want to do it but in the upper right hand corner what you're going to do is hit create project and this
is where the organization comes in you want to give your project a name and describe what you're
trying to achieve this is a personal project so I could name it social media news summarizer and then I
could give it a description let's just say news articles in awesome summaries and social media post out
that's what this project is going to be and that's what we're going to be creating over the next couple of
tips I can hit create project and now we are in the project dashboard where we have a prompt bar on
the left we can add content capture screenshots just like before we have organized chats within this
project and even a project knowledge section which is going to allow us to add tons of different things to
this in order to enhance our workflow tip number 22 is to set custom instructions now when you're
within your projects you have the ability to do something called setting custom instructions and this is
where you get ahead this is where you start to optimize your workflows for Speed and productivity and
where you can really start automating tasks in Claud as you see I made this social media new
summarizer project with the idea in mind that I want to be able to come to this workspace upload news
articles in the links to those news articles and get get social media posts and summaries out for all of
my accounts and then also have a link attribution system where I can attribute the content to wherever I
got it from so I can start this process by setting custom instructions here this is how Claude should
respond to each prompt that comes into that prompt bar when you're in this project you can do this for
multiple other projects with different custom instructions for each that's why projects are so powerful
you instruct Claude how to behave and respond for all of the chats within this social media news
summarizer I can just paste in some custom instructions that I pre-created here and what I basically
have here is I'm giving Claude a role I'm saying you're a social media expert with 10 plus years of
experience with posting on X formerly Twitter and then I give it an objective and that objective is to
analyze large news articles create social media posts that are curated towards my audience in the
artificial intelligence Niche create an X post based around the Articles don't copy the actual text
paraphrase it so we don't plagiarize at the end of every post take the link I uploaded with the article and
put it at the bottom and then I give it a personality trait with a tone and I give it a custom output format to
use I say Twitter post read more about and then I have a custom topic of post section here in Brackets
and then I tell it to provide the link down below I can hit save instructions and now instead of typing out
a prompt this large every single time in each one of my chats when I want an X poost I just have it set
aside in my custom instructions in the background working for me so for example seeing these custom
instructions used in action I could come in here and I could just copy this entire article I could paste in
the article I could say here is the article and I could paste that in just like that and then I could say here
is the link to the article so that I can provide content attribution to my summary and I can just copy the
link right here and paste it in and now I can send that off and it's going to use my exact output
formatting that I set up in the custom instructions it's going to take in that profession in that role that it
has and it's going to curate an X poost for me so as you can see it gives me an actual Twitter post that I
can use right here so I could copy this and then it even provides the link where I got that information
from so I'm not stealing anybody's info very cool how it added emojis and just gave me a nice Twitter
post That's The Power of custom instructions they're custom instructions for how you want Claude to
respond every single time specialized output formatting custom personality four different projects you
name it the possibilities are endless when you start utilizing custom instructions I have a full tutorial
going over that if you really want to learn how to use that I'll put that in the upper right hand corner but
this is something you have to understand and start using within your Cloud toolkit tip number 23 is to
use project knowledge when you're inside one of your projects this adds a whole another layer to the
game if I go back to my social media news summarizer here and I hit add content above the custom
instructions here I have two options I can add text content or I can upload from device for now I'm just
going to hit upload from device and what I'm going going to do is upload a Twitter posting guide for this
guide I have some example Twitter posts for how I want Claude in this case to create Twitter post so if I
click into this you can see that I just have a bunch of different Twitter posts in here going over how I
Page 93
want those Twitter posts created maybe these are Twitter posts that worked well for me in the past so
now when I prompt in Claude I can actually use this project knowledge to my advantage I can paste in
the link to that article that we used earlier and then I can actually paste in the article itself right here I
can just paste it in and it's going to use my custom instructions but now it has project knowledge to
reference as well so down here I could say create the Twitter post using the styling from the and then I
can just say Twitter posting guide because it will be able to reference that in the knowledge database
and I can just put it in quotes right there so now it's going to create a post in the style of the posts that I
uploaded in my project knowledge section you could upload so many different things here like your
social Med media goals your audience numbers your demographic in order to get really tailored down
you have a 200,000 context window equivalent to a 500 page book I've uploaded this 41 lines and have
used 1% of my data and that's not even at scale if I uploaded more it still would probably be a 1% but
I'm going to send this off and we're going to watch how it uses the Twitter posting guide in order to
create a nice Post in that style so as you can see it uses the breaking emojis and does it in that exact
style that I had listed let me just compare the two using the posting guide without using the posting
guide I'm going to copy this and paste it in a doc as you can see this is what it looks like using the
Twitter guide the posting guide that I provided and if we go back to our original chat here's what it
looked like beforehand I'm going to copy and paste so this is without the Twitter guide and this is with it
now I need to tell it to actually put the link at the bottom so that I'm not stealing anybody's information
but other than that it did an amazing job on following this guide and this is a lot more engaging in my
opinion than this so that's an example of how you might use project knowledge and you can go super
Advanced with this I've had people in my AI foundations Community upload entire books to their project
knowledge in order to reference and ask questions about and I've even done that with other
applications tip number 24 is to create workflow shortcuts now I am going to stay in the projects feature
because it's the most powerful feature in Claude in my opinion at the moment and we are going to
update our custom instructions that we created a couple of tips ago and we are going to add shortcuts
to our project so that when we type in certain commands it completely skips out on the custom
instructions and does something else so I'm just going to hit edit on my custom instructions and scroll
all the way down to the bottom and beneath this what I'm going to do is I am going to provide a
shortcuts list so I'm just going to paste that in I created this earlier it says shortcuts for this project and
then here I say I'm going to provide you with shortcuts now this is awesome watch it says shortcuts
override previous instructions if you ever see any of these unique Standalone character combinations
you are to follow the short shortcut instructions and I can say only okay and I have just some shortcuts
in here so I have tldr which stands for too long didn't read and then I say when you see this command
before or after an article you are to skip creating the social media post and give me a general summary
regarding the content in the article very cool maybe I just want to use this as a Content summarizer LP
whenever I say that you were to create a LinkedIn post instead of a Twitter post things just got
interesting and then finally TM Jay this is a fun one tell me a joke about artificial intelligence whenever
this shortcut arises I can just use that one first to show you that it will overcome the previous
instructions and use your shortcuts I can hit save instructions and I can just type in TM AJ and when I
send that off it's going to say here's an AI themed joke for you why don't AI models ever get sick
because they always follow the algorithmic oath don't know what that means let me know if you know
down in the comments but now I could upload that same article that we've been using here off of AI
news's website of course with the link because I'm not taking credit for this post but once I have the link
copied I've got the article copied I could just paste it in here and then I could just say at the very bottom
LP so now it's going to create a LinkedIn post instead of a Twitter post uh because I used LP LinkedIn
post it's going to format it completely differently it's going to be a little bit longer provides the link for
attribution beautiful and yeah this is great used my shortcut for LP and I could do the same thing for tldr
if I send off that shortcut it will give me a general summary just as I asked it and not create any post so
that's how you would do shortcuts in your project workflow in order to add little custom things that
maybe only you know about and maybe they're just Secrets within your project and this is very good for
a project that you want to be like a Swiss army knife you want it to do multiple different things but you
want to maintain one central theme tip number 25 is to combine all the features of projects into one use
project knowledge with custom instructions use shortcuts with project knowledge for custom
Page 94
instructions there are so many different things you can do and this is going to be the last tip on projects
I promise but I want to dive in and show you what I'm talking about I want to upload some more project
knowledge and then show you a visualization of how custom you could get with this just to open your
eyes to the possibilities when using Claude because you have such a high context limit that it would be
a shame not to use it so I'm going to first add more content to my project knowledge and upload that
from the device I'm going to upload a LinkedIn posting guide and then instead of telling it in my prompt
to use the Twitter posting guide or to use the LinkedIn posting guide that's something repetitive that I
could upload to custom instructions so now I want you to reframe your brain I want you to use custom
instructions in order to reference project knowledge because you can call out certain items in your
project knowledge space with your custom instructions at a certain point so you can say after after I
upload an article use the LinkedIn posting guide or use the Twitter posting guide to do this uh you can
reference you can cross reference and the outputs are endless when you start diving into this so I have
my LinkedIn posting guide here with some LinkedIn post uploaded that I really liked and what I can do
is I can edit my custom instructions and under the objective I could add something down here that says
use the Twitter posting guide and model the post from those posts so now I don't have to put that in my
prompt something I'm cutting out of that process just to stop the repetitiveness of it same for the
LinkedIn posting I could go down to the bottom of my constructions for my shortcuts and I could add
this use the LinkedIn posting guide and model the post after that whenever I use the shortcut LP after
an article very cool I can hit save instructions now and now it's going to actually use custom instructions
and reference the project Knowledge from those custom instructions so that I don't have to reference it
from The Prompt itself but I can just do as minimal prompting as possible set up in the back end once
have all the referencing I could even have further instructions further custom instructions in these PDFs
and in this project knowledge that I reference within the custom instructions you it's like Inception you
go further and further into this process now I just wanted to show you this this entire box just look at it
as a Claud project okay we have our different custom instructions in here and within our custom
instructions we have certain shortcuts here's our project knowledge section right here in the middle we
have PDFs and csvs all of that fun stuff and then we have a bunch of different outputs that we could get
by combining different shortcuts with different things in our project knowledge section so this section
right here is actually what you're seeing right here it's the project knowledge the first section is the
custom instructions so the custom instructions right here is like this purple box on the left once you start
combining different shortcuts in your custom instructions with different PDFs you get much different
outputs so maybe in shortcut one of my custom instructions I tell it to reference pdf1 but I also tell it to
reference PDF 1 and PDF 3 down here that output after referencing PDF 1 and PDF 3 could be any
one of these maybe it's that output right but maybe in shortcut two I also want to reference PDF 1 but I
tell it not to reference PDF 3 but CSV 1 that's going to be a completely different output because I'm
referencing two different things with a different shortcut even though I'm referencing one of the same in
each right you have to get creative with your combinations and think of Claud projects in this manner
because your shortcuts can reference different project knowledge or the same and each shortcut can
do a different thing you want your base custom instructions like profession role goal and all of that good
stuff but you want to keep in mind with the shortcuts how you can combine these things maybe in
shortcut three I want it referencing every single thing in Project knowledge to arrive at one single
answer right get creative with it it cross reference things each shortcut can have its own purpose maybe
I want one only going to PDF 3 maybe I want one only going to csv1 those outputs are all going to be
so different from each other because they're referencing multiple different things so keep this visual in
mind when you're using Claude projects it's one of the most important things in Claude that's why I
wanted to map it out for you tip number 26 is to create visualizations in CLA this can be for light things
light and simple things or more complex things this depends on how much you want to actually prompt
to figure out those complex items I have a very basic example that I really wanted to show you and it's
going to be done in one prompt so let's say I want to visualize for myself or other people the concept of
the water cycle evaporation condensation and precipitation what I could do is I could give just a basic
project to Claude for everything that I want out of this visualization or this animation that I want created
using uh a couple of elements like act SVG and inline CSS I could say create an animated visualization
of and then you can copy this prompt too right you don't have to just do the exact same thing that I do
Page 95
you can make your own visualizations but I said of the basic water cycle okay this is a dynamic factor
that is going to be updated based on your preference and your thing that you want visualized but the
first part create an animated visualization of keep that the same and also keep the second part the
same using react SVG which is going to allow you to create images to animate and inline CSS okay
you want to keep that part of the prompt if you're doing these animated visualizations and then you can
just get into your project details and just describe to Claude a little bit more what you want out of this
project so I say focus on the three main processes and then again evaporation condensation
precipitation the animation should look like and then it just goes into what I want the animation to look
like now you may be thinking is this going to work well let's see and find out sometimes it needs revision
but a lot of the time it will do it on the first take so I'm going to send off this prompt and we are going to
see what Claude does Claude is going to be using the artifacts feature as we've seen from previous tips
in order to accomplish this and we may need to edit it just a little bit we may not need to that's the cool
thing about Claude is you have creative control so as we're seeing right now is evaporation the rain
going into the clouds it's animating that for us then we have condensation which I believe is the rain
collection of the cloud then we have precipitation so it's just showing that entire process in a nice cute
animation and it's just going to Loop through that I can even say make the condensation stage more
visually appealing and add lightning flashes during precipitation get creative with it I can send it off
sometimes these edits work sometimes they don't it's just a very fickle thing that you have to play with
right now but it's amazing at how quick it can do this and I highly recommend you dive in and start
creating some of these visualizations so let's take a look at how it's done after it gets done generating
this code we have the evaporation process very similar let's see how it changed condensation if it did at
all so condensation it has it in the clouds now blinking very cool added some more to that let's see if it
added the lightning during precipitation yeah that's very cool so it did add that little flash of lightning
during precipitation so you can edit those things mess around with them and really get this how you
want it and you have the preview over here and you have the code version of it if you want to
implement it elsewhere tip number 27 is to publish your artifacts so we just created that what if we want
to publish it and share it to people and so they can have the ability to remix it and make their own
version of it or just so you can show a diagram to co-workers colleagues or whatever it may be this
doesn't just have to be for visualizations but it can be for interactive PDF dashboards data that you got
cleaned data that you visualized using Claude it can be for literally whatever so it's very simple but a lot
of people don't see this feature they miss out so that's the little publish button down in the right hand
corner right now your artifact is unpublished and only you have access but by publishing it you can
make it accessible to anyone on the internet and the chat will remain private it but the actual artifact you
created itself will not and uh make sure it doesn't include any personal or confidential information
obviously you can hit publish and copy link now I can actually view this public on claude's site so I can
hit this link and I'll be able to view a public version of this animation I can even zoom in on it if I want to
view it a little bit uh brighter but this was the animation that we made in last tip if you did miss out on
that um if you do have an artifact use this exact same method for publishing you even have an option to
go full full screen mode and you also have an option to remix this artifact into um add your own
variations of it claud's going to suggest three ways to remix it automatically just a little bonus tip I'll
throw in here for the remixing when you hit that remix button it'll actually change around the artifact that
you hit remix on tip number 28 is to use problem solving methods in claw you have the ability to run
through different problem solving paradigms in order to find a unique solution to the problem that you're
dealing with or maybe not even unique solution but just a solution to the problem in a unique fun format
and this is going to really open your eyes and open the doors to many different solutions so let me
show you how I go about that now now I have these 20 custom instructions for problem solving
paradigms and I'm just going to show you how I would use one of these I'm going to use the five wise
analysis and this is basically just a problem solving Paradigm that is not anything original that I created
but I cramped it into some custom instructions so that I could allow large language models to solve my
problems in a unique way this is an attempt to peel back the layers of symptoms to uncover the root
cause of a problem by asking why five times to whatever question I have so if I have a problem that I'm
dealing with all the large language model is going to do is ask me why and then give me an analysis of
why I am doing what I'm doing right it's going to peel back the layers and it's going to uncover the root
Page 96
cause of my problem so I've just copied that problem solving Paradigm and I'm just going to paste it into
Claud basically it says when I begin five wise analysis um ask me to clearly Define the problem we're
facing and then I have a stepbystep structure that I want Claude to walk through in order to help me
solve this problem and I can fix all of these uh red lines here got a little weird pasting it in from the
Google Doc and then I can send it off and so it says when I invoke begin five wise analysis it'll start
guiding me through that so I'm just going to invoke it by saying begin five wise analysis now and it's
going to start walking me through my problem so State the problem to start our analysis to find the
problem you're facing and there's so many different problem solving paradigms out there in that list I
have like 20 that I've been using uh and that I have available so very cool stuff uh just so you know
those problem solving paradigms are available within the AI foundations community and I can just walk
through this Paradigm what problem are you trying to solve and then I can just go through my problem
that I want solved I could say I want to eat a cheeseburger but I'm scared I'll gain weight I can send it off
why are you scared that eating a cheeseburger will make you gain weight and it's going to keep asking
me why it's going to ask me why five different times and it helps really peel back the layers so it's
asking me why I'm scared and I can just say because I know the ingredients aren't good for me I can
send it off and it's going to dig further in why do you think the ingredients and the cheeseburger aren't
good for you because I've read the nutrition label okay and this works better for deeper problems like
when you actually need to find a solution and you're not messing around like I am but it says why does
the information on the nutrition label concern you what specific aspects of the nutritional content are
you worried about it's asking me questions diving into the root cause of my issue and I could keep
going and then at the end it gives me an analysis review of the overall cause of my problem it's a very
fun way to solve things or just to get further insight into something that you're dealing with and there's
again many different problem solving paradigms highly recommend you use them when you're using
Claude tip number 29 is to understand your chat controls now we went over a little bit of the chat
controls earlier when we were diving into chat Styles but that fell under more of the appearance
category so what I want to show you now is different ways that you can actually favorite chats and see
all the knowledge that you've used within your chats and a little bit better of a window than trying to
scroll up your PR and figure out where everything was missing and so on so I can just open up some of
my recent chats and I could go to this animated water cycle for instance and your chat controls are in
the upper right hand corner now I'm adding Star Chat into the uh chat controls here because you have
the ability to Star a chat and anytime you star that chat in your sidebar it's going to appear at the top
within the starred section so if you have a chat you like coming back to or you have a big project you're
working on and you don't want to lose it because you're asking Claud so many different questions you
can star it and keep it over there in the start section just fine next uh if you open up your chat controls in
the upper right hand corner you can see a couple of things you can learn more about what model uh
you are using right now and also it's going to keep all of your artifacts and all of your content that you
add in your chat thread and a nice organized list so if you ever need to come back and view that this is
a very good way to do it you can click on things and it just organizes it like that very nicely for you in the
chat control section something that is essential to understand when you using Claude tip number 30 is
to create interactive PDF dashboards in Claude this is amazing because it allows you to get a
workspace for yourself on any PDF and it allows you to quiz yourself test yourself and see all of your
information in a much more visually appealing way when dealing with PDF items so I'm going to show
you how to do that this tip is loved by so many and honestly would definitely make my top three tips for
Claud so definitely pay attention and use this for your workflow so I've just uploaded an entire white
paper PDF over 40 pages long on multimodal Chain of Thought prompting this is by a bunch of different
people an actual white paper huge PDF with a ton of information I mean I am just scrolling and scrolling
and scrolling PDFs super boring to learn from that's why this method is going to help you if you have
large PDFs you're using this for school research whatever it may be create an interactive PDF
dashboard out of it using react and inline CSS let me show you how to do that I can say use react and
inline CSS to create an interactive dashboard based on the information in this PDF add visual appeal
and of course we got to make a dark mode so that's what we're doing I'm going to send this off and it
says certainly I'll create an interactive dashboard from PDF using react and inline CSS with dark mode
theme and this is just going to be epic and I'm actually glad this happened because this happens a lot
Page 97
in Claude when you're trying to generate artifacts if you ever good an error code just copy it in and
paste it in your prompt bar and send it off and uh it should correct itself more times than it doesn't as
you can see it just generates this nice dashboard for us on everything that it has to offer in the PDF we
have key points performance comparison from the model and the prompting techniques used in the
PDF and we even have a little tab data set down here going over model architecture and we can click
around like it's almost a website and it's just such an interactive feel for this PDF that makes it fun to
learn and I can add things like a quiz section or graphs I can just talk very basic add a 10 question quiz
section to test my knowledge on the information in this PDF and also a relevant interactive graph or two
I can send that off and it's going to keep the same structure but just add the things that I want to the
code and it's just ripping through this it's generating everything so quickly keep in mind it's generating
all this from the information in the PDF that we uploaded it looks like it's done now and it looks like it's
definitely added a few different items so it's added this button for show bar chart when I hit that it kind of
messes up so we definitely need some tweet in there but what it has added is this button to start a quiz
when I hit start quiz it gives me a 10 question quiz I think that's what it's going to do uh for this PDF so it
asks me a question and gives me a multiple choice I can hit next and then I can kind of just go through
here and just answer all the questions that it has to ask uh I'm not sure if I'm getting these right but I'm
just kind of guessing as I go and it says quiz completed your score two out of 10 and then I can hit
retake quiz start quiz and then go for it again so it gives me a score gives me a knowledge quiz based
on information so just totally an interactive experience that can be edited tip number 31 is to generate
checklists in Claude this can be generating checklist for future events or revising current checklists you
have to have Claude engineer your day in the most specific way possible one way I like generating
checklist is by taking messy bits of text sent to me by clients sponsors whatever it may be one thing I
like to do mostly when generating checklist with Claude is to take messy emails or messy bits of
information where people want me to do something but they can't get their point across and give me a
step-by-step list I like to paste that in Claude and then have Claude give me a step-by-step list based
on the paragraphs of information from an email from a project whatever it may be let me show you a
quick example so let's say I have a message from my boss let's say I'm struggling at work and he wants
me to catch up on a few things well Carter here sent me an email let's just say this is an arbitrary email
this didn't actually happen but it's just it's a big jumbled mess I know you all get these emails too where
people can't get their point across they have so many different things they want you to do so this is how
the email kind of goes throughout the entire email so I was going to go over some stuff and realized
what we need to do oh wait first did you see that email from the marketing team they're saying the
channel analytics are showing a weird dip might need you to look into that but more importantly we
need to get the next few video scripts done ASAP there's no way we can miss another deadline oh I
almost forgot can you make sure and it just kind of keeps going in this very messy format hard to
capture all your tasks when a message is written this way so I could just say generate me a checklist
based on the contents of this email and I can spell checklist right since that's this tip and then I can
send it off and from all of this text where it's just going over so many different things Claud will generate
me a nice checklist that I can use for everything that needed done in that email and as you can see this
paragraph doesn't look like it would hold this many tasks but it does and it would be very easy to miss
something so generate checklist with Claude it'll help make you more efficient and productive and help
engineer your life in the right direction tip number 32 is a very basic tip use natural language a lot of the
times we get caught up in trying to talk to this computer talk to this AI system like an AI system we try to
be too proper but you can really use things like abbreviations you can spell words wrong again you
don't have to be nice uh I I recommend maybe not not being nice but you don't have to say things like
please just tell it what you want in a very natural humanlike way don't worry about capitalization spelling
even sometimes can go poor grammar it's fine that's all the data that was trained on was human-like
data so it wants you to respond and talk to it like a human as well because that's when it's actually
working in its best environment because it was trained on human data so when you're asking questions
like a robot that's not necessar neily the data was trained on it responds more accurately and better to
humanik conversation and dialogue so use natural language at all times because that's the data the
models we're trained on tip number 33 is to use generated knowledge now this was a big mindset shift
for me when I figured this out because it seemed very simple but you can really start diving in and
Page 98
utilizing this in more ways than one let me show you a quick example so you can wrap your head
around this one I could type in something very basic like create me 10 facts about the Roman Empire
and send it off and then it gives me 10 facts about the Roman Empire but the cool part is is we don't
just have to go use this information but we could add on to it right and we could use this newly
generated knowledge to create something else new so now I could ask Claude to use these 10 facts to
create an engaging research summary for my school assignment and how it ties into history so I'm
generating 10 facts and then I'm using that for another project in the same chat thread this is called
using generated knowledge a very important basic technique to understand when using any large
language model for that matter so I can send that off and now it's going to use these 10 facts to create
me a good research summary and I love how it's just diving into every single one of them very cool and
now we have a research summary built based on the generated Knowledge from the previous prompt
tip number 34 is to enhance your writing with Claude A lot of the times we get caught up in generating
new information and we forget to realize that Claude is here to help us and be our assistant for
information we already have presented out there to the public this is one of the best ways to use Claw
is for writing revision and enhancement and I highly recommend you start implementing this in your
workflows because it's just so powerful and it takes a piece of you it's not completely AI generated but it
takes something from your mind and just makes it better so let's get into it first I could use a previous tip
that we just learned using generated knowledge and I could start off by asking Claude what are the
best keywords for the artificial intelligence Niche give me eight eight kind of a random number but
nobody uses it so let's go with it and it gives me those eight different strong keywords next I could
actually use these keywords to enhance my writing that I already have so let's just say I want to quickly
capture a screenshot of this screen and I want to enhance my hero section copy based on my website I
could go down here to this little camera and capture a screenshot and I could capture that entire page
that I just showed you by hitting share and now added that file to my media here in Claude and it has
my heading and it has a description for that as well very cool so now I can enhance my writing by using
this generated knowledge and writing that I already have so I could say this enhance my hero section
copy for my website dealing with artificial intelligence and add these keywords if possible to make my
work more SEO into keyword Rich so I wanted to use these words if possible because I'm an artificial
intelligence website I'm using it to enhance my existing writing this has already worked but maybe I just
want to enhance it a little bit and add to it to see how it works with different keywords and SEO heavy
topics in my artificial intelligence space very cool right I can send that off and I'm actually using three
different claw tips in this uh tip right here I'm using generated knowledge I'm using that capture
screenshot button and the enhanced writing technique and it gives me this right here and I could even
say bold the changes so I can see what it changed so now as you can see all the changes are in bold
and all the non- changes are in non-bold right so it bolds what it changed and added and it keeps the
same what it didn't add so added this entire bottom paragraph here that would be an example of
enhancing your writing and actually using that bold the changes technique to see where exactly it
enhanced your writing tip number 35 is to analyze call transcripts yes analyze your call transcripts with
Claude I've been doing it with our AI foundations Community whenever we have a live call I throw it in
Claude And I get insights I actually have an entire project for that so that I can go over each call what
we did wrong what we could improve on maybe what questions we didn't answer in entirely and I could
touch up on those or I could get back to those people as soon as possible but we live in a digital age
where we're on Zoom calls we're on Google meets we're doing all of this every single day and with
those calls comes transcripts right and we can actually upload those transcripts to Claude whether
you're just having a personal meeting with your business partner or a big group corporate meeting with
your entire company and we can gain insights from those calls and further remember what we need to
do if there were any action oriented items if there's anything that we need to take away from the call we
can remember it all so let's do it with Claude I'm going to go to my screen and I'm just going to hit add
content and I'm just going to upload these autogenerated captions from one of our Zoom transcripts I'm
going to hit open and now as you can see it's 6,400 lines of an entire call in our AI foundations group
I'm just going to keep scrolling to show you how long this is It's Over 6,400 lines and I'm not even a
quarter of the way down yet so I can ask Claude questions about these call transcripts I can say what
was this call about it says this call was about integrating AI into automations and workflows and then it
Page 99
gives me all of the main topics and even includes names in there for people that we helped says Drake
demonstrated an object detection system built using Claude funny enough I did in this and it was
awesome Carter showed how to set up automations and make integrating tools like air table chat gbt
email Kevin's idea for automating client intake forms and emails Stacy's brainstorming automation it's
going over all these people and all the projects and everything that happened in the call based on the
transcript I could even ask a question like this to put Claude to the test list all the people you can from
this call and a quote from each one I can send that off it says here's a list of people mentioned in the
call along with a quote from each now we had over 25 people in the call but I guess not every single
one of them talked and uh I know it missed some people but Drake I personally believe that
automations they've gotten much more powerful and also a lot more popular Carter I'm using um
Claude 3.5 to do all the coding very good Carter David um sorry if I missed this detail but but is it able
are you able to upload a live link and it just it's so accurate with these call transcripts so highly
recommend you get your calls analyzed and Claud ask questions for further insight and further
understanding tip number 36 is to not become too attached to Claud now I made this first mistake when
I got involved with chat GPT I failed to see the powers of all the other large language models I would
completely block them out because I would only use chat gbt I wouldn't be here making this video
sharing all of these cool tips if I stayed too attached to one large language model and sometimes you
work with one large language model much better than others and it just supports your use cases a little
bit more but there's a multitude of different models you can connect with each other especially when
you start getting into things like make.com and you start combining different model agents and maybe
you have the perplexity large language model do your research for you on the internet you have chat
GPT doing some data analysis for you while you have claw doing the coding for you you can really start
combining these models to do something special and that's what we really teach in our AI foundations
Community is how to not only combine large language models but how to combine any models in
general whether it's AI image generation Audio models music models video models it really doesn't
matter that's what the AI foundations Community is all about is just showing you how to use these tools
Al together like if we go in the classroom here that's what we're doing we have large language model
Mastery notice how it's not claw Mastery or chat gbt Mastery even though I do have the chat gbt
Mastery we went more Broad and just learned how to master large language models in general we took
it from the basics we even have ai image generation we're about mastering all the models and that's
what's helped me grow so much over these three months and expand my knowledge much more is
when you don't become too connected to one tool you realize what's out there you recognize their
strengths and their weaknesses and then you move on but that's all I have for these 36 claw tips and
tricks again as I was just showing you we do have the AI foundations Community if you like the style of
learning you like the energy you want to be a part of a community of AI enthusiasts you want your final
stop for artificial intelligence highly recommend joining the AI foundations Community we're doing much
more of this in the group we're doing multiple live calls per week we're going super in-depth multiple
courses a network of AI Pros sharing so many different things so many different members from all
around the world and it's an amazing experience you will not regret it highly recommend you join but
with that being said if you don't want to join perfectly fine I've got plenty of free content on here on
YouTube that you can just go and enjoy but sub subscribe and like this video if you did enjoy it and
please let me know your feedback in the comments what tips did I miss what tips were you hoping to
see is there anything you want me to make specialized videos for all this is great insight for the AI
foundations's Channel again highly appreciate you for watching this video and sticking it out to the end
if you are still here you are a trooper congratulations I hope that this helps you master Claud and I hope
you can use this as a reference for your future all right I'll see you in the next video
