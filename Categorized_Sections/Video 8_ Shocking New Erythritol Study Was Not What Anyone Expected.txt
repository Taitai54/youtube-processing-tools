we might need to pump the brakes on arrol for just a second we might need to put down the arrol
sweetened drinks we might need to put down the low carb treats for just a second while we unpack this
study because the study that just came out is an Interventional design which means that we take it
more serious than we do say observational studies and just to give you context of what that means and
in 2023 there was a study that came out about arrol that scared a lot of people saying arrol can heart
disease and platelet aggregation and possible clotting but the internet destroyed that study myself
included I did a video on it last year I had a lot of very very esteemed experts talking about it as well it
was practically immoral in how it was designed it basically made it look like aiol was bad and all they did
is like deal with it in a Petri dish really at the end of the day like it was just it was a bad game of
connected dos this study that just came out however 2024 in the summer this one we do need to take
more serious because it's actually from the same research group but what they did is they did an
Interventional design whereas they said okay we know we got destroyed last year let's actually really
take it a step further and take people and make them an intervention group where we give them arrol
and then we monitor what happens somewhat in their body so let's break down what they found and
how you can kind of be safe and thread this needle a little bit after today's video I put a link down below
for element electrolytes they are not sweetened with ariol element electrolytes are 1,000 mg sodium
200 milligrams potassium and 60 milligrams magnesium but that link down below gets you a free
sample variety pack with any purchase of element electrolytes so whether you purchase their sparkling
whether you purchase their stick packs or whatever you get a free sample variety pack and that's
exclusively using my link down below that is drink lnt.com Thomas again drink element.com Thomas
really interesting stuff they curb my appetite entirely but I also have them in a fast and state and I sip on
them during my fasted workouts because I feel like I actually get replenished but I also get my Cravings
satisfied so that link is down below in the description so let's break down what this study did and we're
going to go deeper than the rest of the internet because if you look surface level of the study it's going
to have you throw all your arrol in the trash and this study was designed and definitely is being our
articulated in such a way where even I wanted to do that at first so make no mistake it was well crafted
with how it was put out and the studies let's just get into it they took 20 subjects they had them fast
overnight and they drew their blood they measured what their Baseline blood levels looked like mainly
their platelets and then they gave them 30 gram of ariol or 30 gram of glucose and then Drew their
blood again and measured their platelets okay they treated their platelets with something called ADP
which is an Agonist as well as something that is called thrombin activator peptide 6 so they treated
them in a Petri dish there now let's talk about their findings and what they ultimately found when they
gave subjects arrol there was a 1,000 fold increase in their blood ariol levels that's not that surprising
but it's actually important and relevant because the glucose group didn't have any increase in AR now
arrol is produced in the human body it is produced via a pathway called the pentos phosphate pathway
PPP and this is particularly elevated in unhealthy people okay so what they found is that glucose did
not Elevate any blood levels of arrol at all but Athol certainly did 1,000 fold increase in arrol above
Baseline so okay that's not alarming like it's no surprise that consuming arrol would raise ariol levels but
the point here was that glucose did not increase even through any wraparound way ariol levels but
what was interesting was that there was a quote unquote striking difference in platelet aggregation in
the orthol group so when they looked at the actual petri dish with the platelets when they drew the blood
there was a significant amount of platelets that were clotting with the orthol group and not with the
glucose group what does this really mean it essentially means that more arrol meant more aggregation
more ariol meant more clotting okay so do we need to ditch the sodas do we need to ditch those drinks
well we're going to get to that in a second because we have to remember they drew the blood after
arrol consumption and then they treated it in a weird chemical way they added agonists they basically
tortured the platelet in a Petri dish and saw that they did something I think you're starting to see you're
Page 57
smart you're starting to see wait a minute there's something the rest of the internet is missing here and
it's a critical flipping component okay there was another thing they found though ariol increase dense
granular markers of Serotonin and something called cxcl4 which is sort of a biomarker associated with
that we'll talk about exactly what that means because when you have platelets aggregate okay what
can happen is they can kind of bind to the endothelium the lining of the arterial wo when they bind to
the lining of the arterial wall they can form and cause more of a buildup and eventually could potentially
lean to lead to a thrombosis right so a clot which would cause a massive amount more of platelets to
form when platelets activate they actually release these dense granular type serotonins and cxcl4 so
ser so they actually hold like platelets hold serotonin in them so when they activate they release so the
fact that a rol released these compounds means that platelets did not just aggregate in response to
arrol platelets fullon activated which is actually even more interesting all right pump the brakes now now
we get fun what the heck if you give me an orthol sweetened beverage and then you draw my blood
and you put it in a petri dish and then you take a syringe and you add chemicals and then you take
another syringe and you add more chemicals and agonists and you mix it up in that petri dish that is not
what happens in the human body uh not at all so they didn't measure clotting in the human body they
measured clotting after they drew blood tortured it in a Petri dish and said hey look the arthr group
responded more to these agonists that means practically nothing it really means practically nothing
they're at it again they're going even further to try to like okay we're going to do an Interventional study
but then we're going to kind of manipulate this a little bit they weren't measuring clotting action in the
blood they weren't measuring CXC L4 in the blood they weren't measuring these dense granular type
serotonins in the blood in the human they were doing it in isolation with ridiculous extreme amounts of a
chemical of an Agonist and this thren activator peptide six that's not what happens in the human body
what so I'm all over Instagram and I'm seeing this and I'm seeing like reputable people posting about
this and I'm like no guys like so this I'm not saying that this is a smear campaign on arrol but I'm kind of
saying it's a little bit of a smear campaign on arrol because this is the same group that published an
orthol Study last year that got destroyed same group that published that Xylitol study earlier this year
that tried to take down xylol but again people kind of found the same exact problems with the Xylitol
study as they did with the orthol study and they're always trying to compare it to glucose saying Sugar's
not a problem glucose isn't a problem but get rid of this ariol I don't understand why they would do this I
mean we do know that high circulating levels of blood sugar are problematic and are certainly a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease for clotting for thrombosis do we need to try to take down arrol I guess
we do if it's potentially a threat and maybe arol is just the easiest Target because there's a metabolic
function of arrol for example when I had Dr Ben bman on my channel we talked about aspartame we
talked about slenda there's no real metabolic impact with aspartame and Splenda so it's really hard to
like get into the metabolomics especially like even an untargeted metabolomic study it's really hard to
get into with those compounds because there's no metabolic action there's a Poss POS toxicology
action like but there's no metabolic action ariol there's a potential metabolic action Xylitol there's also a
metabolic action so you could infer or you could also like basically invoke this entire thing to happen by
saying like Okay arrol increases in the blood in unhealthy situations so let's see if actually giving a dose
of arrol makes the body respond as if it's unhealthy right so that ariol increases in unhealthy people so if
you ariol then you're going to increase it and you're going to become unhealthy or you're going to
simulate an unhealthy situation it would simply be like saying as simple as this people with high blood
sugar have diabetes so sugar causes diabetes so if you have sugar you automatically have diabetes
because you ate sugar but that would actually be too kind it's more like saying that person has diabetes
and they have high blood sugar so if you eat sugar and we draw your blood and we torture it a couple
times and you and it's high sugar you have diabetes what if that's how a diagnosis worked right that
would never fly right you see the actual problem now here's the other serious issue with this that's a
snapshot in time one snapshot in time so when you take a blood draw right after arrol consumption and
your orthol levels go up you don't need a give them a chance to come back down they didn't do this
over different times they did 30 minutes after consumption not an additional 60-minute 120 like most
good studies do they did one snapshot so what if your body clears it really fast and it has no effect
because it's cleared so fast so you take one snapshot in time and expect that to be say that's what the
human body's going to do like things are happening over the nanc in our body and there's feedback
Page 58
loops and there's signaling and there's flushing and there's the liver and there's a second path to the
liver and there's all these things and Urth arrol is predominantly urinated out so we have a serious issue
there not to mention it was a 20 participant study which is not super super small but it's also not big and
there were no unhealthy people being studied only healthy people perhaps unhealthy people would
respond entirely different right now so the big question is does a temporary potential increase in platelet
aggregation in a tortured cultured dish really mean anything especially if the alternative is sugary
beverages where we know having consistently high levels of blood sugar would be problematic so think
about it like this these were healthy people that consumed glucose or Athol a healthy person will
respond just fine to glucose if we took an unhealthy population and we gave them Athol or glucose
perhaps the arrol would be a even even in this case a safer option right because an unhealthier your
person is going to respond to glucose entirely different and it could activate the pintos phosphate
pathway and increase orthol in the blood it very well could because you're stoking something that's
already unhealthy so I proposed the question that maybe we needed to pump the breaks on ariol and
I'm saying we need to do more research on this for sure but we should be doing more research on
everything all the time because we have the ability to and we should but this group seems to have a
increasing track record of doing this with ariol and Xylitol in the crosshairs consistently and I think we
need to factor that in but if you take your blood and you put it in a Petri dish and you add chemicals to it
it's going to do weird it just is and I think that's common sense so I know that they are asking for a
re-evaluation for arrol to be considered grass generally recognized as safe and that's fine you know
maybe they due diligence needs to be done there but for now we need to take the data for what it's
worth and it's really unfortunately not much as always keep it locked here my channel see you
tomorrow
